<p class='c011'>On June 27, 1879, Ibsen wrote from Rome to Marcus
Grönvold: “It is now rather hot in Rome, so in about
a week we are going to Amalfi, which, being close to
the sea, is cooler, and offers opportunity for bathing.
I intend to complete there a new dramatic work on
which I am now engaged.” From Amalfi, on September
20, he wrote to John Paulsen: “A new
dramatic work, which I have just completed, has
occupied so much of my time during these last months
that I have had absolutely none to spare for answering
letters.” This “new dramatic work” was <span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><cite>Et
Dukkehjem</cite></span>, which was published in Copenhagen,
December 4, 1879. Dr. George Brandes has given
some account of the episode in real life which suggested
to Ibsen the plot of this play; but the real Nora,
it appears, committed forgery, not to save her husband’s
life, but to redecorate her house. The impulse
received from this incident must have been trifling. It
is much more to the purpose to remember that the
character and situation of Nora had been clearly foreshadowed,
ten years earlier, in the figure of Selma in
<cite>The League of Youth</cite>.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is with <cite>A Doll’s House</cite> that Ibsen enters upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>his kingdom as a world-poet. He had done greater
work in the past, and he was to do greater work in
the future; but this was the play which was destined
to carry his name beyond the limits of Scandinavia,
and even of Germany, to the remotest regions of civilisation.
Here the Fates were not altogether kind to
him. The fact that for many years he was known to
thousands of people solely as the author of <cite>A Doll’s
House</cite>, and its successor, <cite>Ghosts</cite>, was largely responsible
for the extravagant misconceptions of his genius and
character which prevailed during the last decade of
the nineteenth century, and are not yet entirely
extinct. In these plays he seemed to be delivering
a direct assault on marriage, from the standpoint of
feminine individualism; wherefore he was taken to
be a preacher and pamphleteer rather than a poet. In
these plays, and in these only, he made physical disease
a considerable factor in the action; whence it was
concluded that he had a morbid predilection for
“nauseous” subjects. In these plays he laid special
and perhaps disproportionate stress on the influence
of heredity; whence he was believed to be possessed
by a monomania on the point. In these plays, finally,
he was trying to act the essentially uncongenial part
of the prosaic realist. The effort broke down at many
points, and the poet reasserted himself; but these
flaws in the prosaic texture were regarded as mere
bewildering errors and eccentricities. In short, he
was introduced to the world at large through two
plays which showed his power, indeed, almost in perfection,
but left the higher and subtler qualities of
his genius for the most part unrepresented. Hence
the grotesquely distorted vision of him which for so
long haunted the minds even of intelligent people.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>Hence, for example, the amazing opinion, given forth
as a truism by more than one critic of great ability,
that the author of <cite>Peer Gynt</cite> was devoid of humour.</p>

<p class='c001'>Within a little more than a fortnight of its publication
<cite>A Doll’s House</cite> was presented at the Royal
Theatre, Copenhagen, where Fru Hennings, as Nora,
made the great success of her career. The play was
soon being acted, as well as read, all over Scandinavia.
Nora’s startling “declaration of independence”
afforded such an inexhaustible theme for heated discussion,
that at last it had to be formally barred at
social gatherings, just as, in Paris twenty years later,
the Dreyfus Case was proclaimed a prohibited topic.
The popularity of <cite>Pillars of Society</cite> in Germany had
paved the way for its successor, which spread far and
wide over the German stage in the spring of 1880,
and has ever since held its place in the repertory of
the leading theatres. As his works were at that
time wholly unprotected in Germany, Ibsen could not
prevent managers from altering the end of the play to
suit their taste and fancy. He was thus driven, under
protest, to write an alternative ending, in which, at the
last moment, the thought of her children restrained
Nora from leaving home. He preferred, as he said,
“to commit the outrage himself, rather than leave
his work to the tender mercies of adapters.” The
patched-up ending soon dropped out of use and out of
memory. Ibsen’s own account of the matter will be
found in his <cite>Correspondence</cite>, Letter 142.</p>

<p class='c001'>It took ten years for the play to pass beyond
the limits of Scandinavia and Germany. Madame
Modjeska, it is true, presented a version of it in
Louisville, Kentucky, in 1883, but it attracted no
attention. In the following year Messrs. Henry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>Arthur Jones and Henry Herman produced at the
Prince of Wales’s Theatre, London, a play entitled
<cite>Breaking a Butterfly</cite>, which was described as being
“founded on Ibsen’s <cite>Norah</cite>” but bore only a remote
resemblance to the original. In this production Mr.
Beerbohm Tree took the part of Dunkley, a melodramatic
villain who filled the place of Krogstad. In
1885, again, an adventurous amateur club gave a quaint
performance of Miss Lord’s translation of the play
at a hall in Argyle Street, London. Not until June 7,
1889, was a <cite>A Doll’s House</cite> competently, and even
brilliantly, presented to the English public, by Mr.
Charles Charrington and Miss Janet Achurch, at the
Novelty Theatre, London, afterwards re-named the
Great Queen Street Theatre. It was this production
that really made Ibsen known to the English-speaking
peoples. In other words, it marked his second great
stride towards world-wide, as distinct from merely
national, renown—if we reckon as the first stride the
success of <cite>Pillars of Society</cite> in Germany. Mr. and
Mrs. Charrington took <cite>A Doll’s House</cite> with them on
a long Australian tour; Miss Beatrice Cameron
(Mrs. Richard Mansfield) was encouraged by the success
of the London production to present the play in
New York, whence it soon spread to other American
cities; while in London itself it was frequently
revived and vehemently discussed. The Ibsen controversy,
indeed, did not break out in its full virulence
until 1891, when <cite>Ghosts</cite> and <cite>Hedda Gabler</cite> were produced
in London; but from the date of the Novelty
production onwards, Ibsen was generally recognised
as a potent factor in the intellectual and artistic life
of the day.</p>

<p class='c001'>A French adaptation of <span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><cite>Et Dukkehjem</cite></span> was produced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>in Brussels in March 1889, but attracted little
attention. Not until 1894 was the play introduced to
the Parisian public, at the Gymnase, with Madame
Réjane as Nora. This actress has since played the
part frequently, not only in Paris but in London and
in America. In Italian the play was first produced
in 1889, and soon passed into the repertory of Eleonora
Duse, who appeared as Nora in London in 1893. Few
heroines in modern drama have been played by so
many actresses of the first rank. To those already
enumerated must be added Hedwig Niemann-Raabe
and Agnes Sorma in Germany, and Minnie Maddern-Fiske
in America; and, even so, the list is far from
complete. There is probably no country in the world,
possessing a theatre on the European model, in which
<cite>A Doll’s House</cite> has not been more or less frequently
acted.</p>

<p class='c001'>Undoubtedly the great attraction of the part of
Nora to the average actress was the tarantella scene.
This was a theatrical effect, of an obvious, unmistakable
kind. It might have been—though I am not
aware that it ever actually was—made the subject of
a picture-poster. But this, as it seems to me, was
Ibsen’s last concession to the ideal of technique which
he had acquired, in the old Bergen days, from his
French masters. I have elsewhere<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c012'><sup>[1]</sup></a> analysed <cite>A
Doll’s House</cite> at some length, from the technical point
of view, suggesting that it marks a distinct, and one
might almost say a sudden, revolution in the poet’s
understanding of the methods and aims of his art.
There is pretty good reason to suppose, as it seems to
me, that he altered the plan of the play while it
was actually in process of composition. He seems
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>originally to have schemed a “happy ending,” like
that of <cite>The League of Youth</cite> or <cite>Pillars of Society</cite>.
No doubt it is convenient, even for the purposes of
the play as it stands, that all fear of hostile action on
Krogstad’s part should be dissipated before Nora and
Helmer settle down to their final explanation; but is
the convenience sufficiently great to account for the
invention, to that end alone, of Mrs. Linden’s relation
to, and influence over, Krogstad? I very much question
it. I think the “happy ending” which is actually
reached when Krogstad returns the forged document
was, in Ibsen’s original conception, intended to be
equivalent to the stopping of the <cite>Indian Girl</cite>, and the
return of Olaf, in <cite>Pillars of Society</cite>—that is to say,
it was to be the end of the drama properly so
called, and the rest was to be a more or less
conventional winding-up, a confession of faults on
both sides, accompanied by mutual congratulations
on the blowing-over of the threatened storm. This
is the end which, as we see, every one expected: the
end which adapters, in Germany, England, and elsewhere,
insisted on giving to the play. There was just
a shade of excuse for these gentlemen, inasmuch as
the poet himself seemed to have elaborately prepared
the way for them; and I suggest that the fact of his
having done so shows that the play, in embryo, passed
through the phase of technical development represented
by <cite>Pillars of Society</cite>—the phase to which its
amenders would have forced it to return. Ibsen, on
the other hand, when he proceeded from planning in
outline to creation in detail, found his characters outgrow
his plot. When the action, in the theatrical
sense, was over, they were only on the threshold of
the essential drama; and in that drama, compressed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>into the final scene of the play, Ibsen found his true
power and his true mission.</p>

<p class='c001'>How impossible, in his subsequent work, would be
such figures as Mrs. Linden, the confidant, and Krogstad,
the villain!  They are not quite the ordinary
confidant and villain, for Ibsen is always Ibsen, and
his power of vitalisation is extraordinary. Yet we
clearly feel them to belong to a different order of art
from that of his later plays. How impossible, too, in
the poet’s after years, would have been the little
tricks of ironic coincidence and picturesque contrast
which abound in <cite>A Doll’s House</cite>! The festal atmosphere
of the whole play, the Christmas-tree, the
tarantella, the masquerade ball, with its distant sounds
of music—all the shimmer and tinsel of the background
against which Nora’s soul-torture and Rank’s despair
are thrown into relief belong to the system of external,
artificial antithesis beloved by romantic playwrights
from Lope de Vega onward, and carried to its limit
by Victor Hugo. The same artificiality is apparent
in minor details. “Oh, what a wonderful thing it is
to live to be happy!” cries Nora, and instantly “The
hall-door bell rings” and Krogstad’s shadow falls
across the threshold. So, too, for his second entrance,
an elaborate effect of contrast is arranged, between
Nora’s gleeful romp with her children and the
sinister figure which stands unannounced in their
midst. It would be too much to call these things
absolutely unnatural, but the very precision of the coincidence
is eloquent of pre-arrangement. At any rate,
they belong to an order of effects which in future
Ibsen sedulously eschews. The one apparent exception
to this rule which I can remember occurs in <cite>The
Master Builder</cite>, where Solness’s remark, “Presently the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>younger generation will come knocking at my door,”
gives the cue for Hilda’s knock and entrance. But
here an interesting distinction is to be noted.
Throughout <cite>The Master Builder</cite> the poet subtly indicates
the operation of mysterious, unseen agencies—the
“helpers and servers” of whom Solness speaks,
as well as the Power with which he held converse
at the crisis in his life—guiding, or at any rate
tampering with, the destinies of the characters.
This being so, it is evident that the effect of pre-arrangement
produced by Hilda’s appearing exactly
on the given cue was deliberately aimed at. Like so
many other details in the play, it might be a mere
coincidence, or it might be a result of inscrutable
design—we were purposely left in doubt. But the
suggestion of pre-arrangement which helped to create
the atmosphere of the <cite>The Master Builder</cite> was wholly
out of place in <cite>A Doll’s House</cite>. In the later play it
was a subtle stroke of art; in the earlier it was the
effect of imperfectly dissembled artifice.</p>

<p class='c001'>My conjecture of an actual modification of Ibsen’s
design during the progress of the play may possibly
be mistaken. There can be no doubt, on the other
hand, that Ibsen’s full originality first reveals itself
in the latter half of the third act. This is proved by
the very protests, nay, the actual rebellion, which the
last scene called forth. Up to that point he had been
doing, approximately, what theatrical orthodoxy
demanded of him. But when Nora, having put off
her masquerade dress, returned to make up her
account with Helmer, and with marriage as Helmer
understood it, the poet flew in the face of orthodoxy,
and its professors cried out in bewilderment and
wrath. But it was just at this point that, in practice,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>the real grip and thrill of the drama were found to
come in. The tarantella scene never, in my experience—and
I have seen five or six great actresses in the
part—produced an effect in any degree commensurate
with the effort involved. But when Nora and Helmer
faced each other, one on each side of the table, and set
to work to ravel out the skein of their illusions, then
one felt oneself face to face with a new thing in
drama—an order of experience, at once intellectual
and emotional, not hitherto attained in the theatre.
This every one felt, I think, who was in any way
accessible to that order of experience. For my own
part, I shall never forget how surprised I was on first
seeing the play, to find this scene, in its naked simplicity,
far more exciting and moving than all the
artfully-arranged situations of the earlier acts. To
the same effect, from another point of view, we have
the testimony of Fru Hennings, the first actress who
ever played the part of Nora. In an interview published
soon after Ibsen’s death, she spoke of the
delight it was to her, in her youth, to embody the
Nora of the first and second acts, the “lark,” the
“squirrel,” the irresponsible, butterfly Nora. “When
I now play the part,” she went on, “the first acts
leave me indifferent. Not until the third act am I
really interested—but then, intensely.” To call the
first and second acts positively uninteresting would of
course be a gross exaggeration. What one really
means is that their workmanship is still a little derivative
and immature, and that not until the third
act does the poet reveal the full originality and
individuality of his genius.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'><span class='xlarge'>GHOSTS.</span> <br /> <br /> INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The winter of 1879-80 Ibsen spent in Munich, and
the greater part of the summer of 1880 at Berchtesgaden.
November 1880 saw him back in Rome, and
he passed the summer of 1881 at Sorrento. There,
fourteen years earlier, he had written the last acts of
<cite>Peer Gynt</cite>; there he now wrote, or at any rate completed,
<span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><cite>Gengangere</cite></span>. It was published in December
1881, after he had returned to Rome. On December 22
he wrote to Ludwig Passarge, one of his German
translators, “My new play has now appeared, and has
occasioned a terrible uproar in the Scandinavian press;
every day I receive letters and newspaper articles
decrying or praising it.... I consider it utterly impossible
that any German theatre will accept the play
at present. I hardly believe that they will dare to
play it in the Scandinavian countries for some time to
come.” How rightly he judged we shall see anon.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the newspapers there was far more obloquy than
praise. Two men, however, stood by him from the
first: Björnson, from whom he had been practically
estranged ever since <cite>The League of Youth</cite>, and George
Brandes. The latter published an article in which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span>declared (I quote from memory) that the play might
or might not be Ibsen’s greatest work, but that it was
certainly his noblest deed. It was, doubtless, in
acknowledgment of this article that Ibsen wrote to
Brandes on January 3, 1882: “Yesterday I had the
great pleasure of receiving your brilliantly clear and
so warmly appreciative review of <cite>Ghosts</cite>.... All
who read your article must, it seems to me, have their
eyes opened to what I meant by my new book—assuming,
that is, that they have any <em>wish</em> to see. For I
cannot get rid of the impression that a very large
number of the false interpretations which have appeared
in the newspapers are the work of people who
know better. In Norway, however, I am willing to
believe that the stultification has in most cases been
unintentional; and the reason is not far to seek. In
that country a great many of the critics are theologians,
more or less disguised; and these gentlemen
are, as a rule, quite unable to write rationally about
creative literature. That enfeeblement of judgment
which, at least in the case of the average man, is an
inevitable consequence of prolonged occupation with
theological studies, betrays itself more especially in
the judging of human character, human actions, and
human motives. Practical business judgment, on the
other hand, does not suffer so much from studies of
this order. Therefore the reverend gentlemen are
very often excellent members of local boards; but
they are unquestionably our worst critics.” This
passage is interesting as showing clearly the point of
view from which Ibsen conceived the character of
Manders. In the next paragraph of the same letter
he discusses the attitude of “the so-called Liberal
press”; but as the paragraph contains the germ of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xix'>xix</span><cite>An Enemy of the People</cite>, it may most fittingly be
quoted in the introduction to that play.</p>

<p class='c001'>Three days later (January 6) Ibsen wrote to Schandorph,
the Danish novelist: “I was quite prepared
for the hubbub. If certain of our Scandinavian reviewers
have no talent for anything else, they have an
unquestionable talent for thoroughly misunderstanding
and misinterpreting those authors whose books
they undertake to judge.... They endeavour to
make me responsible for the opinions which certain of
the personages of my drama express. And yet there
is not in the whole book a single opinion, a single
utterance, which can be laid to the account of the
author. I took good care to avoid this. The very
method, the order of technique which imposes its
form upon the play, forbids the author to appear in
the speeches of his characters. My object was to make
the reader feel that he was going through a piece of
real experience; and nothing could more effectually
prevent such an impression than the intrusion of the
author’s private opinions into the dialogue. Do they
imagine at home that I am so inexpert in the theory
of drama as not to know this? Of course I know it,
and act accordingly. In no other play that I have
written is the author so external to the action, so
entirely absent from it, as in this last one.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They say,” he continued, “that the book preaches
Nihilism. Not at all. It is not concerned to preach
anything whatsoever. It merely points to the ferment
of Nihilism going on under the surface, at home
as elsewhere. A Pastor Manders will always goad
one or other Mrs. Alving to revolt. And just because
she is a woman, she will, when once she has begun, go
to the utmost extremes.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xx'>xx</span>Towards the end of January Ibsen wrote from
Rome to Olaf Skavlan: “These last weeks have
brought me a wealth of experiences, lessons, and discoveries.
I, of course, foresaw that my new play
would call forth a howl from the camp of the stagnationists;
and for this I care no more than for the
barking of a pack of chained dogs. But the pusillanimity
which I have observed among the so-called
Liberals has given me cause for reflection. The very
day after my play was published the <cite>Dagblad</cite> rushed
out a hurriedly-written article, evidently designed to
purge itself of all suspicion of complicity in my work.
This was entirely unnecessary. I myself am responsible
for what I write, I and no one else. I cannot
possibly embarrass any party, for to no party do
I belong. I stand like a solitary franc-tireur at the
outposts, and fight for my own hand. The only man
in Norway who has stood up freely, frankly, and
courageously for me is Björnson. It is just like him.
He has in truth a great, kingly soul, and I shall never
forget his action in this matter.”</p>

<p class='c001'>One more quotation completes the history of these
stirring January days, as written by Ibsen himself. It
occurs in a letter to a Danish journalist, Otto Borchsenius.
“It may well be,” the poet writes, “that the
play is in several respects rather daring. But it seemed
to me that the time had come for moving some
boundary-posts. And this was an undertaking for
which a man of the older generation, like myself, was
better fitted than the many younger authors who might
desire to do something of the kind. I was prepared
for a storm; but such storms one must not shrink
from encountering. That would be cowardice.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It happened that, just in these days, the present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxi'>xxi</span>writer had frequent opportunities of conversing with
Ibsen, and of hearing from his own lips almost all the
views expressed in the above extracts. He was
especially emphatic, I remember, in protesting against
the notion that the opinions expressed by Mrs. Alving
or Oswald were to be attributed to himself. He
insisted, on the contrary, that Mrs. Alving’s views
were merely typical of the moral chaos inevitably
produced by re-action from the narrow conventionalism
represented by Manders.</p>

<p class='c001'>With one consent, the leading theatres of the three
Scandinavian capitals declined to have anything to do
with the play. It was more than eighteen months old
before it found its way to the stage at all. In August
1883 it was acted for the first time at Helsingborg,
Sweden, by a travelling company under the direction
of an eminent Swedish actor, August Lindberg, who
himself played Oswald. He took it on tour round
the principal cities of Scandinavia, playing it, among
the rest, at a minor theatre in Christiania. It
happened that the boards of the Christiania Theatre
were at the same time occupied by a French farce;
and public demonstrations of protest were made
against the managerial policy which gave <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Tête de
Linotte</cite></span> the preference over <span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><cite>Gengangere</cite></span>. Gradually
the prejudice against the play broke down. Already
in the autumn of 1883 it was produced at the Royal
(Dramatiska) Theatre in Stockholm. When the new
National Theatre was opened in Christiania in 1899,
<span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><cite>Gengangere</cite></span> found an early place in its repertory; and
even the Royal Theatre in Copenhagen has since
opened its doors to the tragedy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Not until April 1886 was <span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><cite>Gespenster</cite></span> acted in
Germany, and then only at a private performance, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxii'>xxii</span>the Stadttheater, Augsburg, the poet himself being
present. In the following winter it was acted at the
famous Court Theatre at Meiningen, again in the
presence of the poet. The first (private) performance
in Berlin took place on January 9, 1887, at the
Residenz Theater; and when the Freie Bühne,
founded on the model of the Paris Théâtre Libre,
began its operations two years later (September 29,
1889), <span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><cite>Gespenster</cite></span> was the first play that it produced.
The Freie Bühne gave the initial impulse to the
whole modern movement which has given Germany a
new dramatic literature; and the leaders of the
movement, whether authors or critics, were one and
all ardent disciples of Ibsen, who regarded <span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><cite>Gespenster</cite></span>
as his typical masterpiece. In Germany, then, the
play certainly did, in Ibsen’s own words, “move
some boundary-posts.” The Prussian censorship,
presently withdrew its veto, and on November 27,
1894, the two leading literary theatres of Berlin, the
Deutsches Theater and the Lessing Theater, gave
simultaneous performances of the tragedy. Everywhere
in Germany and Austria it is now freely performed;
but it is naturally one of the least popular
of Ibsen’s plays.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was with <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Les Revenants</cite></span> that Ibsen made his
first appearance on the French stage. The play was
produced by the Théâtre Libre (at the Théâtre des
Menus-Plaisirs) on May 29, 1890. Here, again, it
became the watchword of the new school of authors
and critics, and aroused a good deal of opposition
among the old school. But the most hostile French
criticisms were moderation itself compared with the
torrents of abuse which were poured upon <cite>Ghosts</cite> by
the journalists of London when, on March 13, 1891,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiii'>xxiii</span>the Independent Theatre, under the direction of Mr.
J. T. Grein, gave a private performance of the play
at the Royalty Theatre, Soho. I have elsewhere<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c012'><sup>[2]</sup></a>
placed upon record some of the amazing feats of
vituperation achieved of the critics, and will not here
recall them. It is sufficient to say that if the play
had been a tenth part as nauseous as the epithets
hurled at it and its author, the Censor’s veto would
have been amply justified. That veto is still (1906)
in force. England enjoys the proud distinction of
being the one country in the world where <cite>Ghosts</cite> may
not be publicly acted.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the United States, the first performance of the
play in English took place at the Berkeley Lyceum,
New York City, on January 5, 1894. The production
was described by Mr. W. D. Howells as “a great
theatrical event—the very greatest I have ever known.”
Other leading men of letters were equally impressed
by it. Five years later, a second production took
place at the Carnegie Lyceum; and an adventurous
manager has even taken the play on tour in the United
States. The Italian version of the tragedy, <span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><cite>Gli Spettri</cite></span>,
has ever since 1892 taken a prominent place in the
repertory of the great actors Zaccone and Novelli,
who have acted it, not only throughout Italy, but in
Austria, Germany, Russia, Spain, and South America.</p>

<p class='c001'>In an interview, published immediately after Ibsen’s
death, Björnstjerne Björnson, questioned as to what
he held to be his brother-poet’s greatest work, replied,
without a moment’s hesitation, <span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><cite>Gengangere</cite></span>.  This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiv'>xxiv</span>dictum can scarcely, I think, be accepted without
some qualification. Even confining our attention to
the modern plays, and leaving out of comparison <cite>The
Pretenders</cite>, <cite>Brand</cite>, and <cite>Peer Gynt</cite>, we can scarcely call
<cite>Ghosts</cite> Ibsen’s richest or most human play, and certainly
not his profoundest or most poetical. If some
omnipotent Censorship decreed the annihilation of all
his works save one, few people, I imagine, would vote
that that one should be <cite>Ghosts</cite>. Even if half a dozen
works were to be saved from the wreck, I doubt
whether I, for my part, would include <cite>Ghosts</cite> in the
list. It is, in my judgment, a little bare, hard, austere.
It is the first work in which Ibsen applies his new
technical method—evolved, as I have suggested, during
the composition of <cite>A Doll’s House</cite>—and he applies it
with something of fanaticism. He is under the sway
of a prosaic ideal—confessed in the phrase, “My
object was to make the reader feel that he was going
through a piece of real experience”—and he is putting
some constraint upon the poet within him. The
action moves a little stiffly, and all in one rhythm.
It lacks variety and suppleness. Moreover, the play
affords some slight excuse for the criticism which
persists in regarding Ibsen as a preacher rather than
as a creator—an author who cares more for ideas and
doctrines than for human beings. Though Mrs.
Alving, Engstrand and Regina are rounded and
breathing characters, it cannot be denied that
Manders strikes one as a clerical type rather than
an individual, while even Oswald might not quite
unfairly be described as simply and solely his father’s
son, an object-lesson in heredity. We cannot be said
to know him, individually and intimately, as we know
Helmer or Stockmann, Hialmar Ekdal or Gregers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxv'>xxv</span>Werle. Then, again, there are one or two curious
flaws in the play. The question whether Oswald’s
“case” is one which actually presents itself in the
medical books seems to me of very trifling moment.
It is typically true, even if it be not true in detail.
The suddenness of the catastrophe may possibly be
exaggerated, its premonitions and even its essential
nature may be misdescribed. On the other hand, I
conceive it probable that the poet had documents to
found upon, which may be unknown to his critics. I
have never taken any pains to satisfy myself upon
the point, which seems to me quite immaterial. There
is not the slightest doubt that the life-history of a
Captain Alving may, and often does, entail upon
posterity consequences quite as tragic as those which
ensue in Oswald’s case, and far more wide-spreading.
That being so, the artistic justification of the poets
presentment of the case is certainly not dependent on
its absolute scientific accuracy. The flaws above
alluded to are of another nature. One of them is
the prominence given to the fact that the Asylum is
uninsured. No doubt there is some symbolical purport
in the circumstance; but I cannot think that it is
either sufficiently clear or sufficiently important to
justify the emphasis thrown upon it at the end of the
second act. Another dubious point is Oswald’s argument
in the first act as to the expensiveness of
marriage as compared with free union. Since the
parties to free union, as he describes it, accept all
the responsibilities of marriage, and only pretermit
the ceremony, the difference of expense, one would
suppose, must be neither more nor less than the actual
marriage fee. I have never seen this remark of
Oswald’s adequately explained, either as a matter of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvi'>xxvi</span>economic fact, or as a trait of character. Another
blemish, of somewhat greater moment, is the inconceivable
facility with which, in the third act, Manders
suffers himself to be victimised by Engstrand. All
these little things, taken together, detract, as it seems
to me, from the artistic completeness of the play, and
impair its claim to rank as the poet’s masterpiece.
Even in prose drama, his greatest and most consummate
achievements were yet to come.</p>

<p class='c001'>Must we, then, wholly dissent from Björnson’s
judgment? I think not. In a historical, if not in
an æsthetic, sense, <cite>Ghosts</cite> may well rank as Ibsen’s
greatest work. It was the play which first gave the
full measure of his technical and spiritual originality
and daring. It has done far more than any other of
his plays to “move boundary-posts.” It has advanced
the frontiers of dramatic art and implanted new
ideals, both technical and intellectual, in the minds of
a whole generation of playwrights. It ranks with
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Hernani</cite></span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>La Dame aux Camélias</cite></span> among the epoch-making
plays of the nineteenth century, while in point
of essential originality it towers above them. We
cannot, I think, get nearer to the truth than George
Brandes did in the above-quoted phrase from his
first notice of the play, describing it as not, perhaps,
the poet’s greatest work, but certainly his noblest
deed. In another essay, Brandes has pointed to it,
with equal justice, as marking Ibsen’s final breach
with his early—one might almost say his hereditary—romanticism.
He here becomes, at last, “the most
modern of the moderns.” “This, I am convinced,”
says the Danish critic, “is his imperishable glory, and
will give lasting life to his works.”</p>

a round table with arm-chairs and a small

a door, and against the same wall, further forward,

little sword. Here are a horse and a trumpet for
Bob. And here are a doll and a cradle for Emmy.
They’re only common; but they’re good enough
for her to pull to pieces. And dress-stuffs and

<p class='c001'>No, I’m sure of that; and, besides, you’ve given

<p class='c001'>No. But it’s not necessary; he’ll come as a

he looks in to-day. I’ve ordered some capital

<p class='c001'>Do you remember last Christmas? For three

every evening till long past midnight to make
flowers for the Christmas-tree, and all sorts of

you see, especially when he won’t touch
any business that’s the least bit—shady, as of course
Torvald never would; and there I quite agree
with him. Oh! you can imagine how glad we
are. He is to enter on his new position at the
New Year, and then he’ll have a large salary, and
percentages. In future we shall be able to live
quite differently—just as we please, in fact. Oh,
Christina, I feel so lighthearted and happy! It’s
delightful to have lots of money, and no need to

    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>

Oh! I haven’t had the chance to be much of a
spendthrift. We have both had to work.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, light fancy work: crochet, and embroidery,
and things of that sort; [<i>Carelessly</i>] and other
work too. You know, of course, that Torvald left
the Government service when we were married.
He had little chance of promotion, and of course
he required to make more money. But in the first
year after our marriage he overworked himself
terribly. He had to undertake all sorts of extra
work, you know, and to slave early and late. He
couldn’t stand it, and fell dangerously ill. Then
the doctors declared he must go to the South.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, we did. It wasn’t easy to manage, I can
tell you. It was just after Ivar’s birth. But of
course we had to go. Oh, it was a wonderful,
delicious journey! And it saved Torvald’s life.
But it cost a frightful lot of money, Christina.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, Christina, just then. And only think! I
couldn’t go and nurse him! I was expecting little
Ivar’s birth daily; and then I had my poor sick
Torvald to attend to. Dear, kind old father! I
never saw him again, Christina. Oh! that’s the

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes; you see, we had the money, and the

  <div class='nf-center'>

I. [<i>Jumps up and claps her hands.</i>] Oh, Christina,
Christina, what a wonderful thing it is to live and

What made you marry him, then?</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>My mother was still alive, you see, bedridden
and helpless; and then I had my two younger

right for me to refuse him.</p>

<p class='c001'>Very well off, I believe. But his business was
uncertain. It fell to pieces at his death, and there
was nothing left.</p>

<p class='c001'>But it would have been fatal for him to know!
Can’t you understand that? He wasn’t even to
suspect how ill he was. The doctors came to me
privately and told me his life was in danger—that
nothing could save him but a winter in the
South. Do you think I didn’t try diplomacy first?
I told him how I longed to have a trip abroad, like
other young wives; I wept and prayed; I said he
ought to think of my condition, and not to thwart
me; and then I hinted that he could borrow the
money. But then, Christina, he got almost angry.
He said I was frivolous, and that it was his duty
as a husband not to yield to my whims and fancies—so
he called them. Very well, thought I, but
saved you must be; and then I found the way to
do it.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>No; never. Papa died at that very time. I

<p class='c001'>Good heavens! What can you be thinking of?
<em class='gesperrt'>Tell him</em>, when he has such a loathing of debt!
And besides—how painful and humiliating it
would be for Torvald, with his manly self-respect,
to know that he owed anything to me! It would
utterly upset the relation between us; our
beautiful, happy home would never again be what
it is.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Will you never tell him?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Thoughtfully, half-smiling.</i>] Yes, some time
perhaps—many, many years hence, when I’m—not
so pretty. You mustn’t laugh at me! Of
course I mean when Torvald is not so much in
love with me as he is now; when it doesn’t amuse
him any longer to see me dancing about, and
dressing up and acting. Then it might be well
to have something in reserve. [<i>Breaking off.</i>]
Nonsense! nonsense! That time will never come.
Now, what do you say to my grand secret,
Christina? Am I fit for nothing now? You
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>may believe it has cost me a lot of anxiety. It has
been no joke to meet my engagements punctually.
You must know, Christina, that in business there
are things called instalments, and quarterly
interest, that are terribly hard to provide for.
So I’ve had to pinch a little here and there,
wherever I could. I couldn’t save much out of
the housekeeping, for of course Torvald had to
live well. And I couldn’t let the children go
about badly dressed; all I got for them, I spent on
them, the blessed darlings!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Poor Nora! So it had to come out of your own
pocket-money.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, of <a id='corr28.16'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='couse'>course</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_28.16'><ins class='correction' title='couse'>course</ins></a></span>. After all, the whole thing was
my doing. When Torvald gave me money for
clothes, and so on, I never spent more than half
of it; I always bought the simplest and cheapest
things. It’s a mercy that everything suits me so
well—Torvald never had any suspicions. But it
was often very hard, Christina dear. For it’s nice
to be beautifully dressed—now, isn’t it?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, and besides that, I made money in other
ways. Last winter I was so lucky—I got a heap
of copying to do. I shut myself up every evening
and wrote far into the night. Oh, sometimes I
was so tired, so tired. And yet it was splendid to
work in that way and earn money. I almost felt
as if I was a man.</p>

any old gentleman: it was only what I used to

nothing for him or his will; for now my troubles
are over. [<i>Springing up.</i>] Oh, Christina, how
glorious it is to think of! Free from all anxiety!
Free, quite free. To be able to play and romp
about with the children; to have things tasteful
and pretty in the house, exactly as Torvald likes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>it! And then the spring will soon be here, with

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Krogstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>When your husband was ill, you came to me to
borrow twelve hundred dollars.</p>

<p class='c001'>I promised to find you the money, on certain

to have the wherewithal for your journey, that
you probably did not give much thought to the

promised to find you the amount in exchange for
a note of hand, which I drew up.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Krogstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Quite right. But then I added a few lines,
making your father security for the debt. Your
father was to sign this.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Krogstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I had left the date blank. That is to say, your

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Krogstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And of course you did so at once; for within

handed you the money.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Krogstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Tell me, Mrs. Helmer: do you happen to
recollect the day of his death? The day of the
month, I mean?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Father died on the 29th of September.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Krogstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Quite correct. I have made inquiries. And
here comes in the remarkable point—[<i>Produces a
paper</i>] which I cannot explain.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>What remarkable point? I don’t know——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Krogstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The remarkable point, madam, that your father
signed this paper three days after his death!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>What! I don’t understand——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Krogstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Your father died on the 29th of September.
But look here: he has dated his signature
October 2nd! Is not that remarkable, Mrs.
Helmer? [<span class='sc'>Nora</span> <i>is silent.</i>] Can you explain it?
[<span class='sc'>Nora</span> <i>continues silent.</i>] It is noteworthy, too, that
the words “October 2nd” and the year are not
in your father’s handwriting, but in one which I
believe I know. Well, this may be explained;
your father may have forgotten to date his signature,
and somebody may have added the date at
random, before the fact of your father’s death
was known. There is nothing wrong in that.
Everything depends on the signature. Of course
it is genuine, Mrs. Helmer? It was really your
father himself who wrote his name here?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>After a short silence, throws her head back and
looks defiantly at him.</i>] No, it was not. <i>I</i> wrote
father’s name.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Krogstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Ah!—Are you aware, madam, that that is a
dangerous admission?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>How so? You will soon get your money.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Krogstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>May I ask you one more question? Why did
you not send the paper to your <a id='corr52.5'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='father'>father?</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_52.5'><ins class='correction' title='father'>father?</ins></a></span></p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It was impossible. Father was ill. If I had
asked him for his signature, I should have had to
tell him why I wanted the money; but he was so
ill I really could not tell him that my husband’s
life was in danger. It was impossible.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Krogstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Then it would have been better to have given
up your tour.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No, I couldn’t do that; my husband’s life
depended on that journey. I couldn’t give it up.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Krogstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And did it never occur to you that you were
playing me false?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>That was nothing to me. I didn’t care in the
least about you. I couldn’t endure you for all
the cruel difficulties you made, although you
knew how ill my husband was.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Krogstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Mrs. Helmer, you evidently do not realise what
you have been guilty of. But I can assure you it
was nothing more and nothing worse that made
me an outcast from society.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You! You want me to believe that you did a
brave thing to save your wife’s life?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Krogstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The law takes no account of motives.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Then it must be a very bad law.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Krogstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Bad or not, if I produce this document in court,
you will be condemned according to law.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I don’t believe that. Do you mean to tell me
that a daughter has no right to spare her dying
father trouble and anxiety?—that a wife has no
right to save her husband’s life? I don’t know
much about the law, but I’m sure you’ll find,
somewhere or another, that that is allowed. And
you don’t know that—you, a lawyer! You must
be a bad one, Mr. Krogstad.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Krogstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Possibly. But business—such business as ours—I
do understand. You believe that? Very
well; now do as you please. But this I may tell
you, that if I am flung into the gutter a second
time, you shall keep me company.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Just think how a man with a thing of that sort
on his conscience must be always lying and canting
and shamming. Think of the mask he must
wear even towards those who stand nearest him—towards
his own wife and children. The effect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>on the children—that’s the most terrible part of
it, Nora.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Helmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Because in such an atmosphere of lies home
life is poisoned and contaminated in every fibre.
Every breath the children draw contains some
germ of evil.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Helmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>As a lawyer, my dear, I have seen it often
enough. Nearly all cases of early corruption may
be traced to lying mothers.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c001'>Why—mothers?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Helmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It generally comes from the mother’s side; but
of course the father’s influence may act in the
same way. Every lawyer knows it too well. And
here has this Krogstad been poisoning his own
children for years past by a life of lies and
hypocrisy—that is why I call him morally ruined.
[<i>Holds out both hands to her.</i>] So my sweet little
Nora must promise not to plead his cause. Shake
hands upon it. Come, come, what’s this? Give
me your hand. That’s right. Then it’s a bargain.
I assure you it would have been impossible for
me to work with him. It gives me a positive
sense of physical discomfort to come in contact
with such people.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Sewing.</i>] So you’re to be in costume to-morrow,
Nora? I’ll tell you what—I shall come in for a
moment to see you in all your glory. But I’ve
quite forgotten to thank you for the pleasant
evening yesterday.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Rises and walks across the room.</i>] Oh, yesterday,
it didn’t seem so pleasant as usual.—You should
have come to town a little sooner, Christina.—Torvald
has certainly the art of making home
bright and beautiful.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You too, I should think, or you wouldn’t be
your father’s daughter. But tell me—is Doctor
Rank always so depressed as he was last evening?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No, yesterday it was particularly noticeable.
You see, he suffers from a dreadful illness. He
has spinal consumption, poor fellow. They say
his father was a horrible man, who kept mistresses
and all sorts of things—so the son has been sickly
from his childhood, you understand.</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Lets her sewing fall into her lap.</i>] Why, my

things?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Moving about the room.</i>] Oh, when one has
three children, one sometimes has visits from
women who are half—half doctors—and they talk
of one thing and another.</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Goes on sewing; a short pause.</i>] Does Doctor

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Every day of his life. He has been Torvald’s
most intimate friend from boyhood, and he’s a
good friend of mine too. Doctor Rank is quite
one of the family.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But tell me—is he quite sincere? I mean,
isn’t he rather given to flattering people?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No, quite the contrary. Why should you think
so?</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>When you introduced us yesterday he said he
had often heard my name; but I noticed afterwards
that your husband had no notion who I
was. How could Doctor Rank——?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>He was quite right, Christina. You see, Torvald
loves me so indescribably, he wants to have me
all to himself, as he says. When we were first
married he was almost jealous if I even mentioned
any of my old friends at home; so naturally I
gave up doing it. But I often talk of the old
times to Doctor Rank, for he likes to hear about
them.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Listen to me, Nora! You are still a child in
many ways. I am older than you, and have had
more experience. I’ll tell you <a id='corr68.21'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='something?'>something.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_68.21'><ins class='correction' title='something?'>something.</ins></a></span> You

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The whole affair, I should say. You were

to find you money——</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And it is just by pleading his cause that you
make it impossible for me to keep him. It’s
already known at the Bank that I intend to
dismiss Krogstad. If it were now reported that

<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>feel the consequences. And besides—there is
one thing that makes Krogstad impossible for me

<p class='c001'>And I hear he is good at his work. But the
fact is, he was a college chum of mine—there was
one of those rash friendships between us that one
so often repents of later. I may as well confess
it at once—he calls me by my Christian name;<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c012'><sup>[9]</sup></a>
and he is tactless enough to do it even when
others are present. He delights in putting on
airs of familiarity—Torvald here, Torvald there!

make my position at the Bank perfectly unendurable.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Krogstad.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c001'>Certainly, with all due respect. But since you
are so anxious to keep the matter secret, I suppose
you are a little clearer than yesterday as to what
you have done.</p>

<p class='c001'>Only to see how you are getting on, Mrs. Helmer.
I’ve been thinking about you all day.
Even a mere money-lender, a gutter-journalist,
a—in short, a creature like me—has a little bit of

fight my way up, step by step. Now, I’ve been
thrust down again, and I will not be satisfied with
merely being reinstated as a matter of grace. I
want to rise, I tell you. I must get into the Bank

dances her tarantella with wild applause, and well
she deserved it, I must say—though there was,
perhaps, a little too much nature in her rendering
of the idea—more than was, strictly speaking,
artistic. But never mind—the point is, she made
a great success, a tremendous success. Was I to
let her remain after that—to weaken the impression?
Not if I know it. I took my sweet little
Capri girl—my capricious little Capri girl, I might
say—under my arm; a rapid turn round the room,
a curtsey to all sides, and—as they say in novels—the
lovely apparition vanished! An exit should
always be effective, Mrs. Linden; but I can’t get
Nora to see it. By Jove! it’s warm here. [<i>Throws

the other. When I look back on it now, I seem
to have been living here like a beggar, from hand
to mouth. I lived by performing tricks for you,
Torvald. But you would have it so. You and
father have done me a great wrong. It is your

<p class='c001'>I know nothing but what Pastor Hansen told
me when I was confirmed. He explained that
religion was this and that. When I get away from
all this and stand alone, I will look into that
matter too. I will see whether what he taught
me is right, or, at any rate, whether it is right
for me.</p>

let me appeal to your conscience—for I suppose
you have some moral feeling? Or, answer me:
perhaps you have none?</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, Torvald, it’s not easy to say. I really
don’t know—I am all at sea about these things.
I only know that I think quite differently from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>you about them. I hear, too, that the laws are
different from what I thought; but I can’t believe
that they can be right. It appears that a woman
has no right to spare her dying father, or to save
her husband’s life! I don’t believe that.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yes, I can. It was this evening, when the miracle

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I have waited so patiently all these eight years;
for of course I saw clearly enough that miracles
don’t happen every day. When this crushing blow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>threatened me, I said to myself so confidently,
“Now comes the miracle!”  When Krogstad’s
letter lay in the box, it never for a moment
occurred to me that you would think of submitting
to that man’s conditions. I was convinced that
you would say to him, “Make it known to all the
world”; and that then——</p>

<p class='c001'>Very likely. But you neither think nor talk
like the man I can share my life with. When your
terror was over—not for what threatened me, but
for yourself—when there was nothing more to fear—then
it seemed to you as though nothing had
happened. I was your lark again, your doll, just
as before—whom you would take twice as much
care of in future, because she was so weak and
fragile. [<i>Stands up.</i>] Torvald—in that moment

<p class='c001'>[<i>Quickly.</i>] I left it down at the inn. I shall

<p class='c001'>[<i>Suppressing a smile.</i>] Are you really not to be

<p class='c001'>No, no, Mrs. Alving; many thanks. I shall stay
at the inn, as usual. It is so conveniently near
the landing-stage.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now you are making fun of me. Ah, you’re
naturally in great spirits to-day—what with
to-morrow’s festival and Oswald’s return.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes; you can think what a delight it is to me!
It’s more than two years since he was home last.
And now he has promised to stay with me all the
winter.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Has he really? That is very nice and dutiful
of him. For I can well believe that life in Rome
and Paris has very different attractions from any
we can offer here.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Ah, but here he has his mother, you see. My

mother!</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It would be grievous indeed, if absence and
absorption in art and that sort of thing were to
blunt his natural feelings.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, you may well say so. But there’s nothing
of that sort to fear with him. I’m quite curious to
see whether you know him again. He’ll be down
presently; he’s upstairs just now, resting a little
on the sofa. But do sit down, my dear Pastor.</p>

<p class='c001'>Very well. Then let me show you——[<i>He

Now, to begin with, here is——[<i>Breaking off.</i>]
Tell me, Mrs. Alving, how do these books come to
be here?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c001'>These books? They are books I am reading.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Do you read this sort of literature?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Certainly I do.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Do you feel better or happier for such reading?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I feel, so to speak, more secure.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>That is strange. How do you mean?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, I seem to find explanation and confirmation
of all sorts of things I myself have been
thinking. For that is the wonderful part of it,
Pastor Manders—there is really nothing new in
these books, nothing but what most people think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>and believe. Only most people either don’t
formulate it to themselves, or else keep quiet
about it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Great heavens! Do you really believe that
most people——?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I do, indeed.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But surely not in this country? Not here
among us?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, certainly; here as elsewhere.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, I really must say——!</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>For the rest, what do you object to in these
books?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Object to in them? You surely do not suppose
that I have nothing better to do than to study
such publications as these?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>That is to say, you know nothing of what you
are condemning?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I have read enough <em class='gesperrt'>about</em> these writings to
disapprove of them.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes; but your own judgment——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>My dear Mrs. Alving, there are many occasions
in life when one must rely upon others. Things
are so ordered in this world; and it is well that
they are. Otherwise, what would become of
society?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, well, I daresay you’re right there.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Besides, I of course do not deny that there may
be much that is attractive in such books. Nor
can I blame you for wishing to keep up with the
intellectual movements that are said to be going
on in the great world—where you have let your
son pass so much of his life. But——</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Lowering his voice.</i>] But one should not talk
about it, Mrs. Alving. One is certainly not bound
to account to everybody for what one reads and
thinks within one’s own four walls.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Of course not; I quite agree with you.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Only think, now, how you are bound to consider
the interests of this Orphanage, which you decided
on founding at a time when—if I understand you
rightly—you thought very differently on spiritual
matters.</p>

<p class='c001'>Oh, yes; I quite admit that. But it was about
the Orphanage——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It was about the Orphanage we were to speak;
yes. All I say is: prudence, my dear lady! And
now let us get to business. [<i>Opens the packet, and
takes out a number of papers.</i>] Do you see these?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The documents?</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>All—and in perfect order. I can tell you it
was hard work to get them in time. I had to
put on strong pressure. The authorities are
almost morbidly scrupulous when there is any
decisive step to be taken. But here they are at
last. [<i>Looks through the bundle.</i>] See! here is the
formal deed of gift of the parcel of ground known
as Solvik in the Manor of Rosenvold, with all the
newly constructed buildings, schoolrooms, master’s
house, and chapel. And here is the legal fiat for
the endowment and for the Bye-laws of the Institution.
Will you look at them? [<i>Reads.</i>] “Bye-laws
for the Children’s Home to be known as
‘Captain Alving’s Foundation.’”</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I have chosen the designation “Captain” rather
than “Chamberlain.” “Captain” looks less

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And here you have the Bank Account of the

expenses of the Orphanage.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Thank you; but please keep it—it will be more
convenient.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>With pleasure. I think we will leave the
money in the Bank for the present. The interest
is certainly not what we could wish—four per
cent. and six months’ notice of withdrawal. If a
good mortgage could be found later on—of course
it must be a first mortgage and an unimpeachable
security—then we could consider the matter.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Certainly, my dear Pastor Manders. You are

    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I will keep my eyes open at any rate.—But now
there is one thing more which I have several

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>

    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Shall the Orphanage buildings be insured or
not?</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, wait a moment, Mrs. Alving. Let us look

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Of course you have—on your own estate. And
so have I—of course. But here, you see, it is
quite another matter. The Orphanage is to be
consecrated, as it were, to a higher purpose.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Is there any considerable number of people—really

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>There, you see! In town we have many such

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, I know—I know; my conscience would
be quite easy, that is true enough. But nevertheless
we should not escape grave misinterpretation;
and that might very likely react unfavourably
upon the Orphanage.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>Nor can I entirely lose sight of the difficult—I
may even say painful—position in which <em>I</em>
might perhaps be placed. In the leading circles
of the town, people take a lively interest in
this Orphanage. It is, of course, founded partly
for the benefit of the town, as well; and it
is to be hoped it will, to a considerable extent,
result in lightening our Poor Rates. Now, as I

<p class='c001'>Oh, not at all. A healthy lad is all the better
for it; especially when he’s an only child. He
oughtn’t to hang on at home with his mother and
father, and get spoilt.</p>

<p class='c001'>That is a very disputable point, Mrs. Alving.

of his fathers.</p>

him; and I am the last to approve the life he led

But a wife is not appointed to be her husband’s
judge. It was your duty to bear with humility the
cross which a Higher Power had, in its wisdom,
laid upon you. But instead of that you rebelliously
throw away the cross, desert the back-slider
whom you should have supported, go and
risk your good name and reputation, and—nearly
succeed in ruining other people’s reputation into
the bargain.</p>

<p class='c001'>I was but a poor instrument in a Higher Hand.
And what a blessing has it not proved to you, all the
days of your life, that I induced you to resume the
yoke of duty and obedience! Did not everything
happen as I foretold? Did not Alving turn his
back on his errors, as a man should? Did he not
live with you from that time, lovingly and blamelessly,
all his days? Did he not become a benefactor
to the whole district? And did he not help
you to rise to his own level, so that you, little by
little, became his assistant in all his undertakings?
And a capital assistant, too—oh, I know, Mrs.
Alving, <em class='gesperrt'>that</em> praise is due to you.—But now I
come to the next great error in your life.</p>

endure any bond. Everything that has weighed
upon you in life you have cast away without care
or conscience, like a burden you were free to throw
off at will. It did not please you to be a wife any
longer, and you left your husband. You found it
troublesome to be a mother, and you sent your

<p class='c001'>Yes, you are; you <em class='gesperrt'>must</em> be. And in what state

well, Mrs. Alving. You sinned greatly against your

Turn back yourself, and save what may yet be

<p class='c001'>All that you have just said about my husband

all that you know nothing from personal observation.

<p class='c001'>Yes; and in my husband’s lifetime you never

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, then, Pastor Manders—I will tell you the

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The truth is that my husband died just as

    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

  <div class='nf-center'>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It almost makes me dizzy. Your whole married
life, the seeming union of all these years, was
nothing more than a hidden abyss!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Neither more nor less. Now you know it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>This is—this is inconceivable to me. I cannot
grasp it! I cannot realise it! But how was it
possible to——? How could such a state of
things be kept <a id='corr207.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='recret'>secret</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_207.19'><ins class='correction' title='recret'>secret</ins></a></span>?</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>That has been my ceaseless struggle, day after
day. After Oswald’s birth, I thought Alving
seemed to be a little better. But it did not last
long. And then I had to struggle twice as hard,
fighting as though for life or death, so that nobody
should know what sort of man my child’s father
was. And you know what power Alving had of
winning people’s hearts. Nobody seemed able to
believe anything but good of him. He was one
of those people whose life does not bite upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>their reputation. But at last, Mr. Manders—for
you must know the whole story—the most
repulsive thing of all happened.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>More repulsive than what you have told me!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I had gone on bearing with him, although I
knew very well the secrets of his life out of doors.
But when he brought the scandal within our own
walls——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Impossible! Here!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes; here in our own home. It was there
[<i>Pointing towards the first door on the right</i>], in the
dining-room, that I first came to know of it. I
was busy with something in there, and the door
was standing ajar. I heard our housemaid come
up from the garden, with water for those flowers.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well——?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Soon after, I heard Alving come in too. I heard
him say something softly to her. And then I
heard—[<i>With a short laugh</i>]—oh! it still sounds
in my ears, so hateful and yet so ludicrous—I
heard my own servant-maid whisper, “Let me
go, Mr. Alving! Let me be!”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>What unseemly levity on his part! But it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>cannot have been more than levity, Mrs. Alving;
believe me, it cannot.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I soon knew what to believe. Mr. Alving had
his way with the girl; and that connection had
consequences, Mr. Manders.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>As though petrified.</i>] Such things in this house!
in this house!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I had borne a great deal in this house. To keep
him at home in the evenings, and at night, I had
to make myself his boon companion in his secret
orgies up in his room. There I have had to sit
alone with him, to clink glasses and drink with
him, and to listen to his ribald, silly talk. I have
had to fight with him to get him dragged to
bed——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Moved.</i>] And you were able to bear all this!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I had to bear it for my little boy’s sake. But
when the last insult was added; when my own
servant-maid——; then I swore to myself: This
shall come to an end! And so I took the reins
into my own hand—the whole control—over him
and everything else. For now I had a weapon
against him, you see; he dared not oppose me.
It was then I sent Oswald away from home. He
was nearly seven years old, and was beginning to
observe and ask questions, as children do. That
I could not bear.  It seemed to me the child
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>must be poisoned by merely breathing the air of
this polluted home. That was why I sent him
away. And now you can see, too, why he was
never allowed to set foot inside his home so long
as his father lived. No one knows what that
cost me.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You have indeed had a life of trial.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I could never have borne it if I had not had my
work. For I may truly say that I have worked!
All the additions to the estate—all the improvements—all
the labour-saving appliances, that
Alving was so much praised for having introduced—do
you suppose he had energy for anything of
the sort?—he, who lay all day on the sofa, reading
an old Court Guide! No; but I may tell you <em class='gesperrt'>this</em>
too: when he had his better intervals, it was I
who urged him on; it was I who had to drag the
whole load when he relapsed into his evil ways,
or sank into querulous wretchedness.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And it is to this man that you raise a memorial?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>There you see the power of an evil conscience.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It always seemed to me impossible but that the
truth must come out and be believed. So the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>Orphanage was to deaden all rumours and set
every doubt at rest.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>In that you have certainly not missed your aim,
Mrs. Alving.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And besides, I had one other reason. I was
determined that Oswald, my own boy, should
inherit nothing whatever from his father.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Then it is Alving’s fortune that——?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes. The sums I have spent upon the Orphanage,
year by year, make up the amount—I have
reckoned it up precisely—the amount which made
Lieutenant Alving “a good match” in his day.</p>

</div>

  </div>

<p class='c001'>To her——But then, Engstrand is not——?
Good God, Mrs. Alving, it’s impossible! You
must be mistaken after all.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Unfortunately there is no possibility of mistake.
Johanna confessed everything to me; and Alving
could not deny it. So there was nothing to be
done but to get the matter hushed up.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No, you could do nothing else.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The girl left our service at once, and got a good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>sum of money to hold her tongue for the time.
The rest she managed for herself when she got to
town. She renewed her old acquaintance with
Engstrand, no doubt let him see that she had
money in her purse, and told him some tale about
a foreigner who put in here with a yacht that
summer. So she and Engstrand got married in
hot haste. Why, you married them yourself.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But then how to account for——? I recollect
distinctly Engstrand coming to give notice of the
marriage. He was quite overwhelmed with contrition,
and bitterly reproached himself for the
misbehaviour he and his sweetheart had been
guilty of.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes; of course he had to take the blame upon
himself.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But such a piece of duplicity on his part! And
towards me too! I never could have believed
it of Jacob Engstrand. I shall not fail to take
him seriously to task; he may be sure of that.—And
then the immorality of such a connection!
For money——! How much did the
girl receive?</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Just think of it—for a miserable three hundred

<p class='c001'>Then what have you to say of me? I went and

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Why—good heavens!—what are you talking

    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Do you think Alving was any purer when I

  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, but there is a world of difference between
the two cases——</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Not so much difference after all—except in the
price:—a miserable three hundred dollars and a
whole fortune.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>How can you compare such absolutely dissimilar

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well then, with your nearest relatives—as your

aunts.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, that is true. Those three cast up the
account for me. Oh, it’s marvellous how clearly
they made out that it would be downright madness
to refuse such an offer. If mother could only
see me now, and know what all that grandeur has
come to!</p>

<p class='c001'>Nobody can be held responsible for the result.

<p class='c001'>Ghosts! When I heard Regina and Oswald in
there, it was as though ghosts rose up before me.
But I almost think we are all of us ghosts, Pastor
Manders. It is not only what we have inherited
from our father and mother that “walks” in us. It
is all sorts of dead ideas, and lifeless old beliefs,
and so forth. They have no vitality, but they
cling to us all the same, and we cannot shake
them off. Whenever I take up a newspaper,
I seem to see ghosts gliding between the lines.
There must be ghosts all the country over,
as thick as the sands of the sea. And then
we are, one and all, so pitifully afraid of the
light.</p>

<p class='c001'>When Johanna had got into trouble through
that Englishman—or it might have been an
American or a Russian, as they call them—well,
you see, she came down into the town. Poor
thing, she’d sent me about my business once or
twice before: for she couldn’t bear the sight of
anything as wasn’t handsome; and I’d got this
damaged leg of mine. Your Reverence recollects
how I ventured up into a dancing saloon, where
seafaring men was carrying on with drink and
devilry, as the saying goes. And then, when I
was for giving them a bit of an admonition to
lead a new life——</p>

<p class='c001'>[<i>At the window.</i>] H’m——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I know all about that, Engstrand; the ruffians
threw you downstairs. You have told me of the
affair already. Your infirmity is an honour to you.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Engstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I’m not puffed up about it, your Reverence.
But what I wanted to say was, that when she came
and confessed all to me, with weeping and gnashing
of teeth, I can tell your Reverence I was sore
at heart to hear it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c001'>Were you indeed, Engstrand? Well, go on.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>So I says to her, “The American, he’s sailing
about on the boundless sea. And as for you,
Johanna,” says I, “you’ve committed a grievous
sin, and you’re a fallen creature. But Jacob Engstrand,”
says I, “he’s got two good legs to stand
upon, he has——” You see, your Reverence, I
was speaking figurative-like.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Engstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, that was how I raised her up and made
an honest woman of her, so as folks shouldn’t get
to know how as she’d gone astray with foreigners.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, wait a minute!—now I recollect. Johanna
<em class='gesperrt'>did</em> have a trifle of money. But I would have
nothing to do with <em class='gesperrt'>that</em>. “No,” says I, “that’s
mammon; that’s the wages of sin. This dirty
gold—or notes, or whatever it was—we’ll just fling
that back in the American’s face,” says I. But
he was off and away, over the stormy sea, your
Reverence.</p>

<p class='c001'>Was he really, my good fellow?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Engstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>He was indeed, sir. So Johanna and I, we
agreed that the money should go to the child’s
education; and so it did, and I can account for
every blessed farthing of it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Why, this alters the case considerably.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Engstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>That’s just how it stands, your Reverence. And
I make so bold as to say as I’ve been an honest
father to Regina, so far as my poor strength went;
for I’m but a weak vessel, worse luck!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, well, my good fellow——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Engstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>All the same, I bear myself witness as I’ve
brought up the child, and lived kindly with poor
Johanna, and ruled over my own house, as the
Scripture has it. But it couldn’t never enter my
head to go to your Reverence and puff myself up
and boast because even the likes of me had done
some good in the world. No, sir; when anything
of that sort happens to Jacob Engstrand, he holds
his tongue about it. It don’t happen so terrible
often, I daresay. And when I do come to see
your Reverence, I find a mortal deal that’s wicked
and weak to talk about. For I said it before, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>I says it again—a man’s conscience isn’t always as
clean as it might be.</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, assuredly. And I do it with all my heart.

wish I could give you some proof of my hearty
regret, and of my good-will towards you——</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Engstrand.</span></div>
  </div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well then, here’s the very chance. With the

might set up a Sailors’ Home down in the town.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes; it might be a sort of Orphanage, too, in a
manner of speaking. There’s such a many temptations
for seafaring folk ashore. But in this Home
of mine, a man might feel like as he was under
a father’s eye, I was thinking.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, yes; we will look into the matter more

<p class='c001'>It was directly after I had been home last time,

<p class='c001'>There was no anchor for the <a href='#f14'>footnote</a> on p. 276. An anchor
has been placed on the most likely <a href='#r14'>spot</a>, based on the context.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are quite a few instances of missing punctuation. The
conventional period following the character’s name is sometimes
missing and has been added for consistency’s sake without
further comment. Those missing from setting and stage direction
are also added without comment, since there is no obvious purpose to be
served by the omission. However, the restoration of punctuation
missing from dialogue is noted below, since the punctuation is
frequently expressive. Several instances of dubious ‘?’ marks have
been corrected, based on context.</p>

<p class='c001'>Volume I of this series included errata for each succeeding volume,
but noted none in Volume VII.</p>

<p class='c001'>The contraction ‘mustn’t’ appears twenty-one times, but twice
without the internal ‘t’ as ‘musn’t’. These have been corrected.</p>

<p class='c001'>Errors deemed most likely to be the printer’s have been corrected, and
are noted here. The references are to the page and line in the original.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
