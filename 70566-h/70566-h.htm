</div>

<p class='c011'>On June 27, 1879, Ibsen wrote from Rome to Marcus
Grönvold: “It is now rather hot in Rome, so in about
a week we are going to Amalfi, which, being close to
the sea, is cooler, and offers opportunity for bathing.
I intend to complete there a new dramatic work on
which I am now engaged.” From Amalfi, on September
20, he wrote to John Paulsen: “A new
dramatic work, which I have just completed, has
occupied so much of my time during these last months
that I have had absolutely none to spare for answering
letters.” This “new dramatic work” was <span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><cite>Et
Dukkehjem</cite></span>, which was published in Copenhagen,
December 4, 1879. Dr. George Brandes has given
some account of the episode in real life which suggested
to Ibsen the plot of this play; but the real Nora,
it appears, committed forgery, not to save her husband’s
life, but to redecorate her house. The impulse
received from this incident must have been trifling. It
is much more to the purpose to remember that the
character and situation of Nora had been clearly foreshadowed,
ten years earlier, in the figure of Selma in
<cite>The League of Youth</cite>.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is with <cite>A Doll’s House</cite> that Ibsen enters upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>his kingdom as a world-poet. He had done greater
work in the past, and he was to do greater work in
the future; but this was the play which was destined
to carry his name beyond the limits of Scandinavia,
and even of Germany, to the remotest regions of civilisation.
Here the Fates were not altogether kind to
him. The fact that for many years he was known to
thousands of people solely as the author of <cite>A Doll’s
House</cite>, and its successor, <cite>Ghosts</cite>, was largely responsible
for the extravagant misconceptions of his genius and
character which prevailed during the last decade of
the nineteenth century, and are not yet entirely
extinct. In these plays he seemed to be delivering
a direct assault on marriage, from the standpoint of
feminine individualism; wherefore he was taken to
be a preacher and pamphleteer rather than a poet. In
these plays, and in these only, he made physical disease
a considerable factor in the action; whence it was
concluded that he had a morbid predilection for
“nauseous” subjects. In these plays he laid special
and perhaps disproportionate stress on the influence
of heredity; whence he was believed to be possessed
by a monomania on the point. In these plays, finally,
he was trying to act the essentially uncongenial part
of the prosaic realist. The effort broke down at many
points, and the poet reasserted himself; but these
flaws in the prosaic texture were regarded as mere
bewildering errors and eccentricities. In short, he
was introduced to the world at large through two
plays which showed his power, indeed, almost in perfection,
but left the higher and subtler qualities of
his genius for the most part unrepresented. Hence
the grotesquely distorted vision of him which for so
long haunted the minds even of intelligent people.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>Hence, for example, the amazing opinion, given forth
as a truism by more than one critic of great ability,
that the author of <cite>Peer Gynt</cite> was devoid of humour.</p>

<p class='c001'>Within a little more than a fortnight of its publication
<cite>A Doll’s House</cite> was presented at the Royal
Theatre, Copenhagen, where Fru Hennings, as Nora,
made the great success of her career. The play was
soon being acted, as well as read, all over Scandinavia.
Nora’s startling “declaration of independence”
afforded such an inexhaustible theme for heated discussion,
that at last it had to be formally barred at
social gatherings, just as, in Paris twenty years later,
the Dreyfus Case was proclaimed a prohibited topic.
The popularity of <cite>Pillars of Society</cite> in Germany had
paved the way for its successor, which spread far and
wide over the German stage in the spring of 1880,
and has ever since held its place in the repertory of
the leading theatres. As his works were at that
time wholly unprotected in Germany, Ibsen could not
prevent managers from altering the end of the play to
suit their taste and fancy. He was thus driven, under
protest, to write an alternative ending, in which, at the
last moment, the thought of her children restrained
Nora from leaving home. He preferred, as he said,
“to commit the outrage himself, rather than leave
his work to the tender mercies of adapters.” The
patched-up ending soon dropped out of use and out of
memory. Ibsen’s own account of the matter will be
found in his <cite>Correspondence</cite>, Letter 142.</p>

<p class='c001'>It took ten years for the play to pass beyond
the limits of Scandinavia and Germany. Madame
Modjeska, it is true, presented a version of it in
Louisville, Kentucky, in 1883, but it attracted no
attention. In the following year Messrs. Henry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>Arthur Jones and Henry Herman produced at the
Prince of Wales’s Theatre, London, a play entitled
<cite>Breaking a Butterfly</cite>, which was described as being
“founded on Ibsen’s <cite>Norah</cite>” but bore only a remote
resemblance to the original. In this production Mr.
Beerbohm Tree took the part of Dunkley, a melodramatic
villain who filled the place of Krogstad. In
1885, again, an adventurous amateur club gave a quaint
performance of Miss Lord’s translation of the play
at a hall in Argyle Street, London. Not until June 7,
1889, was a <cite>A Doll’s House</cite> competently, and even
brilliantly, presented to the English public, by Mr.
Charles Charrington and Miss Janet Achurch, at the
Novelty Theatre, London, afterwards re-named the
Great Queen Street Theatre. It was this production
that really made Ibsen known to the English-speaking
peoples. In other words, it marked his second great
stride towards world-wide, as distinct from merely
national, renown—if we reckon as the first stride the
success of <cite>Pillars of Society</cite> in Germany. Mr. and
Mrs. Charrington took <cite>A Doll’s House</cite> with them on
a long Australian tour; Miss Beatrice Cameron
(Mrs. Richard Mansfield) was encouraged by the success
of the London production to present the play in
New York, whence it soon spread to other American
cities; while in London itself it was frequently
revived and vehemently discussed. The Ibsen controversy,
indeed, did not break out in its full virulence
until 1891, when <cite>Ghosts</cite> and <cite>Hedda Gabler</cite> were produced
in London; but from the date of the Novelty
production onwards, Ibsen was generally recognised
as a potent factor in the intellectual and artistic life
of the day.</p>

<p class='c001'>A French adaptation of <span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><cite>Et Dukkehjem</cite></span> was produced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>in Brussels in March 1889, but attracted little
attention. Not until 1894 was the play introduced to
the Parisian public, at the Gymnase, with Madame
Réjane as Nora. This actress has since played the
part frequently, not only in Paris but in London and
in America. In Italian the play was first produced
in 1889, and soon passed into the repertory of Eleonora
Duse, who appeared as Nora in London in 1893. Few
heroines in modern drama have been played by so
many actresses of the first rank. To those already
enumerated must be added Hedwig Niemann-Raabe
and Agnes Sorma in Germany, and Minnie Maddern-Fiske
in America; and, even so, the list is far from
complete. There is probably no country in the world,
possessing a theatre on the European model, in which
<cite>A Doll’s House</cite> has not been more or less frequently
acted.</p>

<p class='c001'>Undoubtedly the great attraction of the part of
Nora to the average actress was the tarantella scene.
This was a theatrical effect, of an obvious, unmistakable
kind. It might have been—though I am not
aware that it ever actually was—made the subject of
a picture-poster. But this, as it seems to me, was
Ibsen’s last concession to the ideal of technique which
he had acquired, in the old Bergen days, from his
French masters. I have elsewhere<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c012'><sup>[1]</sup></a> analysed <cite>A
Doll’s House</cite> at some length, from the technical point
of view, suggesting that it marks a distinct, and one
might almost say a sudden, revolution in the poet’s
understanding of the methods and aims of his art.
There is pretty good reason to suppose, as it seems to
me, that he altered the plan of the play while it
was actually in process of composition. He seems
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>originally to have schemed a “happy ending,” like
that of <cite>The League of Youth</cite> or <cite>Pillars of Society</cite>.
No doubt it is convenient, even for the purposes of
the play as it stands, that all fear of hostile action on
Krogstad’s part should be dissipated before Nora and
Helmer settle down to their final explanation; but is
the convenience sufficiently great to account for the
invention, to that end alone, of Mrs. Linden’s relation
to, and influence over, Krogstad? I very much question
it. I think the “happy ending” which is actually
reached when Krogstad returns the forged document
was, in Ibsen’s original conception, intended to be
equivalent to the stopping of the <cite>Indian Girl</cite>, and the
return of Olaf, in <cite>Pillars of Society</cite>—that is to say,
it was to be the end of the drama properly so
called, and the rest was to be a more or less
conventional winding-up, a confession of faults on
both sides, accompanied by mutual congratulations
on the blowing-over of the threatened storm. This
is the end which, as we see, every one expected: the
end which adapters, in Germany, England, and elsewhere,
insisted on giving to the play. There was just
a shade of excuse for these gentlemen, inasmuch as
the poet himself seemed to have elaborately prepared
the way for them; and I suggest that the fact of his
having done so shows that the play, in embryo, passed
through the phase of technical development represented
by <cite>Pillars of Society</cite>—the phase to which its
amenders would have forced it to return. Ibsen, on
the other hand, when he proceeded from planning in
outline to creation in detail, found his characters outgrow
his plot. When the action, in the theatrical
sense, was over, they were only on the threshold of
the essential drama; and in that drama, compressed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>into the final scene of the play, Ibsen found his true
power and his true mission.</p>

<p class='c001'>How impossible, in his subsequent work, would be
such figures as Mrs. Linden, the confidant, and Krogstad,
the villain!  They are not quite the ordinary
confidant and villain, for Ibsen is always Ibsen, and
his power of vitalisation is extraordinary. Yet we
clearly feel them to belong to a different order of art
from that of his later plays. How impossible, too, in
the poet’s after years, would have been the little
tricks of ironic coincidence and picturesque contrast
which abound in <cite>A Doll’s House</cite>! The festal atmosphere
of the whole play, the Christmas-tree, the
tarantella, the masquerade ball, with its distant sounds
of music—all the shimmer and tinsel of the background
against which Nora’s soul-torture and Rank’s despair
are thrown into relief belong to the system of external,
artificial antithesis beloved by romantic playwrights
from Lope de Vega onward, and carried to its limit
by Victor Hugo. The same artificiality is apparent
in minor details. “Oh, what a wonderful thing it is
to live to be happy!” cries Nora, and instantly “The
hall-door bell rings” and Krogstad’s shadow falls
across the threshold. So, too, for his second entrance,
an elaborate effect of contrast is arranged, between
Nora’s gleeful romp with her children and the
sinister figure which stands unannounced in their
midst. It would be too much to call these things
absolutely unnatural, but the very precision of the coincidence
is eloquent of pre-arrangement. At any rate,
they belong to an order of effects which in future
Ibsen sedulously eschews. The one apparent exception
to this rule which I can remember occurs in <cite>The
Master Builder</cite>, where Solness’s remark, “Presently the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>younger generation will come knocking at my door,”
gives the cue for Hilda’s knock and entrance. But
here an interesting distinction is to be noted.
Throughout <cite>The Master Builder</cite> the poet subtly indicates
the operation of mysterious, unseen agencies—the
“helpers and servers” of whom Solness speaks,
as well as the Power with which he held converse
at the crisis in his life—guiding, or at any rate
tampering with, the destinies of the characters.
This being so, it is evident that the effect of pre-arrangement
produced by Hilda’s appearing exactly
on the given cue was deliberately aimed at. Like so
many other details in the play, it might be a mere
coincidence, or it might be a result of inscrutable
design—we were purposely left in doubt. But the
suggestion of pre-arrangement which helped to create
the atmosphere of the <cite>The Master Builder</cite> was wholly
out of place in <cite>A Doll’s House</cite>. In the later play it
was a subtle stroke of art; in the earlier it was the
effect of imperfectly dissembled artifice.</p>

<p class='c001'>My conjecture of an actual modification of Ibsen’s
design during the progress of the play may possibly
be mistaken. There can be no doubt, on the other
hand, that Ibsen’s full originality first reveals itself
in the latter half of the third act. This is proved by
the very protests, nay, the actual rebellion, which the
last scene called forth. Up to that point he had been
doing, approximately, what theatrical orthodoxy
demanded of him. But when Nora, having put off
her masquerade dress, returned to make up her
account with Helmer, and with marriage as Helmer
understood it, the poet flew in the face of orthodoxy,
and its professors cried out in bewilderment and
wrath. But it was just at this point that, in practice,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>the real grip and thrill of the drama were found to
come in. The tarantella scene never, in my experience—and
I have seen five or six great actresses in the
part—produced an effect in any degree commensurate
with the effort involved. But when Nora and Helmer
faced each other, one on each side of the table, and set
to work to ravel out the skein of their illusions, then
one felt oneself face to face with a new thing in
drama—an order of experience, at once intellectual
and emotional, not hitherto attained in the theatre.
This every one felt, I think, who was in any way
accessible to that order of experience. For my own
part, I shall never forget how surprised I was on first
seeing the play, to find this scene, in its naked simplicity,
far more exciting and moving than all the
artfully-arranged situations of the earlier acts. To
the same effect, from another point of view, we have
the testimony of Fru Hennings, the first actress who
ever played the part of Nora. In an interview published
soon after Ibsen’s death, she spoke of the
delight it was to her, in her youth, to embody the
Nora of the first and second acts, the “lark,” the
“squirrel,” the irresponsible, butterfly Nora. “When
I now play the part,” she went on, “the first acts
leave me indifferent. Not until the third act am I
really interested—but then, intensely.” To call the
first and second acts positively uninteresting would of
course be a gross exaggeration. What one really
means is that their workmanship is still a little derivative
and immature, and that not until the third
act does the poet reveal the full originality and
individuality of his genius.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'><span class='xlarge'>GHOSTS.</span> <br /> <br /> INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The winter of 1879-80 Ibsen spent in Munich, and
the greater part of the summer of 1880 at Berchtesgaden.
November 1880 saw him back in Rome, and
he passed the summer of 1881 at Sorrento. There,
fourteen years earlier, he had written the last acts of
<cite>Peer Gynt</cite>; there he now wrote, or at any rate completed,
<span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><cite>Gengangere</cite></span>. It was published in December
1881, after he had returned to Rome. On December 22
he wrote to Ludwig Passarge, one of his German
translators, “My new play has now appeared, and has
occasioned a terrible uproar in the Scandinavian press;
every day I receive letters and newspaper articles
decrying or praising it.... I consider it utterly impossible
that any German theatre will accept the play
at present. I hardly believe that they will dare to
play it in the Scandinavian countries for some time to
come.” How rightly he judged we shall see anon.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the newspapers there was far more obloquy than
praise. Two men, however, stood by him from the
first: Björnson, from whom he had been practically
estranged ever since <cite>The League of Youth</cite>, and George
Brandes. The latter published an article in which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span>declared (I quote from memory) that the play might
or might not be Ibsen’s greatest work, but that it was
certainly his noblest deed. It was, doubtless, in
acknowledgment of this article that Ibsen wrote to
Brandes on January 3, 1882: “Yesterday I had the
great pleasure of receiving your brilliantly clear and
so warmly appreciative review of <cite>Ghosts</cite>.... All
who read your article must, it seems to me, have their
eyes opened to what I meant by my new book—assuming,
that is, that they have any <em>wish</em> to see. For I
cannot get rid of the impression that a very large
number of the false interpretations which have appeared
in the newspapers are the work of people who
know better. In Norway, however, I am willing to
believe that the stultification has in most cases been
unintentional; and the reason is not far to seek. In
that country a great many of the critics are theologians,
more or less disguised; and these gentlemen
are, as a rule, quite unable to write rationally about
creative literature. That enfeeblement of judgment
which, at least in the case of the average man, is an
inevitable consequence of prolonged occupation with
theological studies, betrays itself more especially in
the judging of human character, human actions, and
human motives. Practical business judgment, on the
other hand, does not suffer so much from studies of
this order. Therefore the reverend gentlemen are
very often excellent members of local boards; but
they are unquestionably our worst critics.” This
passage is interesting as showing clearly the point of
view from which Ibsen conceived the character of
Manders. In the next paragraph of the same letter
he discusses the attitude of “the so-called Liberal
press”; but as the paragraph contains the germ of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xix'>xix</span><cite>An Enemy of the People</cite>, it may most fittingly be
quoted in the introduction to that play.</p>

<p class='c001'>Three days later (January 6) Ibsen wrote to Schandorph,
the Danish novelist: “I was quite prepared
for the hubbub. If certain of our Scandinavian reviewers
have no talent for anything else, they have an
unquestionable talent for thoroughly misunderstanding
and misinterpreting those authors whose books
they undertake to judge.... They endeavour to
make me responsible for the opinions which certain of
the personages of my drama express. And yet there
is not in the whole book a single opinion, a single
utterance, which can be laid to the account of the
author. I took good care to avoid this. The very
method, the order of technique which imposes its
form upon the play, forbids the author to appear in
the speeches of his characters. My object was to make
the reader feel that he was going through a piece of
real experience; and nothing could more effectually
prevent such an impression than the intrusion of the
author’s private opinions into the dialogue. Do they
imagine at home that I am so inexpert in the theory
of drama as not to know this? Of course I know it,
and act accordingly. In no other play that I have
written is the author so external to the action, so
entirely absent from it, as in this last one.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“They say,” he continued, “that the book preaches
Nihilism. Not at all. It is not concerned to preach
anything whatsoever. It merely points to the ferment
of Nihilism going on under the surface, at home
as elsewhere. A Pastor Manders will always goad
one or other Mrs. Alving to revolt. And just because
she is a woman, she will, when once she has begun, go
to the utmost extremes.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xx'>xx</span>Towards the end of January Ibsen wrote from
Rome to Olaf Skavlan: “These last weeks have
brought me a wealth of experiences, lessons, and discoveries.
I, of course, foresaw that my new play
would call forth a howl from the camp of the stagnationists;
and for this I care no more than for the
barking of a pack of chained dogs. But the pusillanimity
which I have observed among the so-called
Liberals has given me cause for reflection. The very
day after my play was published the <cite>Dagblad</cite> rushed
out a hurriedly-written article, evidently designed to
purge itself of all suspicion of complicity in my work.
This was entirely unnecessary. I myself am responsible
for what I write, I and no one else. I cannot
possibly embarrass any party, for to no party do
I belong. I stand like a solitary franc-tireur at the
outposts, and fight for my own hand. The only man
in Norway who has stood up freely, frankly, and
courageously for me is Björnson. It is just like him.
He has in truth a great, kingly soul, and I shall never
forget his action in this matter.”</p>

<p class='c001'>One more quotation completes the history of these
stirring January days, as written by Ibsen himself. It
occurs in a letter to a Danish journalist, Otto Borchsenius.
“It may well be,” the poet writes, “that the
play is in several respects rather daring. But it seemed
to me that the time had come for moving some
boundary-posts. And this was an undertaking for
which a man of the older generation, like myself, was
better fitted than the many younger authors who might
desire to do something of the kind. I was prepared
for a storm; but such storms one must not shrink
from encountering. That would be cowardice.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It happened that, just in these days, the present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxi'>xxi</span>writer had frequent opportunities of conversing with
Ibsen, and of hearing from his own lips almost all the
views expressed in the above extracts. He was
especially emphatic, I remember, in protesting against
the notion that the opinions expressed by Mrs. Alving
or Oswald were to be attributed to himself. He
insisted, on the contrary, that Mrs. Alving’s views
were merely typical of the moral chaos inevitably
produced by re-action from the narrow conventionalism
represented by Manders.</p>

<p class='c001'>With one consent, the leading theatres of the three
Scandinavian capitals declined to have anything to do
with the play. It was more than eighteen months old
before it found its way to the stage at all. In August
1883 it was acted for the first time at Helsingborg,
Sweden, by a travelling company under the direction
of an eminent Swedish actor, August Lindberg, who
himself played Oswald. He took it on tour round
the principal cities of Scandinavia, playing it, among
the rest, at a minor theatre in Christiania. It
happened that the boards of the Christiania Theatre
were at the same time occupied by a French farce;
and public demonstrations of protest were made
against the managerial policy which gave <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Tête de
Linotte</cite></span> the preference over <span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><cite>Gengangere</cite></span>. Gradually
the prejudice against the play broke down. Already
in the autumn of 1883 it was produced at the Royal
(Dramatiska) Theatre in Stockholm. When the new
National Theatre was opened in Christiania in 1899,
<span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><cite>Gengangere</cite></span> found an early place in its repertory; and
even the Royal Theatre in Copenhagen has since
opened its doors to the tragedy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Not until April 1886 was <span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><cite>Gespenster</cite></span> acted in
Germany, and then only at a private performance, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxii'>xxii</span>the Stadttheater, Augsburg, the poet himself being
present. In the following winter it was acted at the
famous Court Theatre at Meiningen, again in the
presence of the poet. The first (private) performance
in Berlin took place on January 9, 1887, at the
Residenz Theater; and when the Freie Bühne,
founded on the model of the Paris Théâtre Libre,
began its operations two years later (September 29,
1889), <span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><cite>Gespenster</cite></span> was the first play that it produced.
The Freie Bühne gave the initial impulse to the
whole modern movement which has given Germany a
new dramatic literature; and the leaders of the
movement, whether authors or critics, were one and
all ardent disciples of Ibsen, who regarded <span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><cite>Gespenster</cite></span>
as his typical masterpiece. In Germany, then, the
play certainly did, in Ibsen’s own words, “move
some boundary-posts.” The Prussian censorship,
presently withdrew its veto, and on November 27,
1894, the two leading literary theatres of Berlin, the
Deutsches Theater and the Lessing Theater, gave
simultaneous performances of the tragedy. Everywhere
in Germany and Austria it is now freely performed;
but it is naturally one of the least popular
of Ibsen’s plays.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was with <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Les Revenants</cite></span> that Ibsen made his
first appearance on the French stage. The play was
produced by the Théâtre Libre (at the Théâtre des
Menus-Plaisirs) on May 29, 1890. Here, again, it
became the watchword of the new school of authors
and critics, and aroused a good deal of opposition
among the old school. But the most hostile French
criticisms were moderation itself compared with the
torrents of abuse which were poured upon <cite>Ghosts</cite> by
the journalists of London when, on March 13, 1891,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiii'>xxiii</span>the Independent Theatre, under the direction of Mr.
J. T. Grein, gave a private performance of the play
at the Royalty Theatre, Soho. I have elsewhere<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c012'><sup>[2]</sup></a>
placed upon record some of the amazing feats of
vituperation achieved of the critics, and will not here
recall them. It is sufficient to say that if the play
had been a tenth part as nauseous as the epithets
hurled at it and its author, the Censor’s veto would
have been amply justified. That veto is still (1906)
in force. England enjoys the proud distinction of
being the one country in the world where <cite>Ghosts</cite> may
not be publicly acted.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the United States, the first performance of the
play in English took place at the Berkeley Lyceum,
New York City, on January 5, 1894. The production
was described by Mr. W. D. Howells as “a great
theatrical event—the very greatest I have ever known.”
Other leading men of letters were equally impressed
by it. Five years later, a second production took
place at the Carnegie Lyceum; and an adventurous
manager has even taken the play on tour in the United
States. The Italian version of the tragedy, <span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><cite>Gli Spettri</cite></span>,
has ever since 1892 taken a prominent place in the
repertory of the great actors Zaccone and Novelli,
who have acted it, not only throughout Italy, but in
Austria, Germany, Russia, Spain, and South America.</p>

<p class='c001'>In an interview, published immediately after Ibsen’s
death, Björnstjerne Björnson, questioned as to what
he held to be his brother-poet’s greatest work, replied,
without a moment’s hesitation, <span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><cite>Gengangere</cite></span>.  This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiv'>xxiv</span>dictum can scarcely, I think, be accepted without
some qualification. Even confining our attention to
the modern plays, and leaving out of comparison <cite>The
Pretenders</cite>, <cite>Brand</cite>, and <cite>Peer Gynt</cite>, we can scarcely call
<cite>Ghosts</cite> Ibsen’s richest or most human play, and certainly
not his profoundest or most poetical. If some
omnipotent Censorship decreed the annihilation of all
his works save one, few people, I imagine, would vote
that that one should be <cite>Ghosts</cite>. Even if half a dozen
works were to be saved from the wreck, I doubt
whether I, for my part, would include <cite>Ghosts</cite> in the
list. It is, in my judgment, a little bare, hard, austere.
It is the first work in which Ibsen applies his new
technical method—evolved, as I have suggested, during
the composition of <cite>A Doll’s House</cite>—and he applies it
with something of fanaticism. He is under the sway
of a prosaic ideal—confessed in the phrase, “My
object was to make the reader feel that he was going
through a piece of real experience”—and he is putting
some constraint upon the poet within him. The
action moves a little stiffly, and all in one rhythm.
It lacks variety and suppleness. Moreover, the play
affords some slight excuse for the criticism which
persists in regarding Ibsen as a preacher rather than
as a creator—an author who cares more for ideas and
doctrines than for human beings. Though Mrs.
Alving, Engstrand and Regina are rounded and
breathing characters, it cannot be denied that
Manders strikes one as a clerical type rather than
an individual, while even Oswald might not quite
unfairly be described as simply and solely his father’s
son, an object-lesson in heredity. We cannot be said
to know him, individually and intimately, as we know
Helmer or Stockmann, Hialmar Ekdal or Gregers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxv'>xxv</span>Werle. Then, again, there are one or two curious
flaws in the play. The question whether Oswald’s
“case” is one which actually presents itself in the
medical books seems to me of very trifling moment.
It is typically true, even if it be not true in detail.
The suddenness of the catastrophe may possibly be
exaggerated, its premonitions and even its essential
nature may be misdescribed. On the other hand, I
conceive it probable that the poet had documents to
found upon, which may be unknown to his critics. I
have never taken any pains to satisfy myself upon
the point, which seems to me quite immaterial. There
is not the slightest doubt that the life-history of a
Captain Alving may, and often does, entail upon
posterity consequences quite as tragic as those which
ensue in Oswald’s case, and far more wide-spreading.
That being so, the artistic justification of the poets
presentment of the case is certainly not dependent on
its absolute scientific accuracy. The flaws above
alluded to are of another nature. One of them is
the prominence given to the fact that the Asylum is
uninsured. No doubt there is some symbolical purport
in the circumstance; but I cannot think that it is
either sufficiently clear or sufficiently important to
justify the emphasis thrown upon it at the end of the
second act. Another dubious point is Oswald’s argument
in the first act as to the expensiveness of
marriage as compared with free union. Since the
parties to free union, as he describes it, accept all
the responsibilities of marriage, and only pretermit
the ceremony, the difference of expense, one would
suppose, must be neither more nor less than the actual
marriage fee. I have never seen this remark of
Oswald’s adequately explained, either as a matter of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvi'>xxvi</span>economic fact, or as a trait of character. Another
blemish, of somewhat greater moment, is the inconceivable
facility with which, in the third act, Manders
suffers himself to be victimised by Engstrand. All
these little things, taken together, detract, as it seems
to me, from the artistic completeness of the play, and
impair its claim to rank as the poet’s masterpiece.
Even in prose drama, his greatest and most consummate
achievements were yet to come.</p>

<p class='c001'>Must we, then, wholly dissent from Björnson’s
judgment? I think not. In a historical, if not in
an æsthetic, sense, <cite>Ghosts</cite> may well rank as Ibsen’s
greatest work. It was the play which first gave the
full measure of his technical and spiritual originality
and daring. It has done far more than any other of
his plays to “move boundary-posts.” It has advanced
the frontiers of dramatic art and implanted new
ideals, both technical and intellectual, in the minds of
a whole generation of playwrights. It ranks with
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Hernani</cite></span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>La Dame aux Camélias</cite></span> among the epoch-making
plays of the nineteenth century, while in point
of essential originality it towers above them. We
cannot, I think, get nearer to the truth than George
Brandes did in the above-quoted phrase from his
first notice of the play, describing it as not, perhaps,
the poet’s greatest work, but certainly his noblest
deed. In another essay, Brandes has pointed to it,
with equal justice, as marking Ibsen’s final breach
with his early—one might almost say his hereditary—romanticism.
He here becomes, at last, “the most
modern of the moderns.” “This, I am convinced,”
says the Danish critic, “is his imperishable glory, and
will give lasting life to his works.”</p>

They’re only common; but they’re good enough

<p class='c001'>No, you must begin; I won’t be egotistical

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes; isn’t it? A lawyer’s position is so uncertain,
you see, especially when he won’t touch
any business that’s the least bit—shady, as of course
Torvald never would; and there I quite agree
with him. Oh! you can imagine how glad we
are. He is to enter on his new position at the
New Year, and then he’ll have a large salary, and
percentages. In future we shall be able to live
quite differently—just as we please, in fact. Oh,
Christina, I feel so lighthearted and happy! It’s
delightful to have lots of money, and no need to
worry about things, isn’t it?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes; at any rate it must be delightful to have
what you need.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No, not only what you need, but heaps of
money—<em class='gesperrt'>heaps</em>!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Smiling.</i>] Nora, Nora, haven’t you learnt
reason yet? In our schooldays you were a
shocking little spendthrift.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Quietly smiling.</i>] Yes; that’s what Torvald
says I am still. [<i>Holding up her forefinger.</i>] But
“Nora, Nora” is not so silly as you all think.
Oh! I haven’t had the chance to be much of a
spendthrift. We have both had to work.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You too?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, light fancy work: crochet, and embroidery,
and things of that sort; [<i>Carelessly</i>] and other
work too. You know, of course, that Torvald left
the Government service when we were married.
He had little chance of promotion, and of course
he required to make more money. But in the first
year after our marriage he overworked himself
terribly. He had to undertake all sorts of extra
work, you know, and to slave early and late. He
couldn’t stand it, and fell dangerously ill. Then
the doctors declared he must go to the South.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You spent a whole year in Italy, didn’t you?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, we did. It wasn’t easy to manage, I can
tell you. It was just after Ivar’s birth. But of
course we had to go. Oh, it was a wonderful,
delicious journey! And it saved Torvald’s life.
But it cost a frightful lot of money, Christina.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>So I should think.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Twelve hundred dollars! Four thousand eight
hundred crowns!<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c012'><sup>[7]</sup></a> Isn’t that a lot of money?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>How lucky you had the money to spend!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>We got it from father, you must know.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Ah, I see. He died just about that time,
didn’t he?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, Christina, just then. And only think! I
couldn’t go and nurse him! I was expecting little
Ivar’s birth daily; and then I had my poor sick
Torvald to attend to. Dear, kind old father! I
never saw him again, Christina. Oh! that’s the
hardest thing I have had to bear since my
marriage.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I know how fond you were of him. But then
you went to Italy?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes; you see, we had the money, and the
doctors said we must lose no time. We started a
month later.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And your husband came back completely cured.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Sound as a bell.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But—the doctor?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>What do you mean?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I thought as I came in your servant announced
the doctor——</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, yes; Doctor Rank. But he doesn’t come
professionally. He is our best friend, and never
lets a day pass without looking in. No, Torvald
hasn’t had an hour’s illness since that time. And
the children are so healthy and well, and so am
I. [<i>Jumps up and claps her hands.</i>] Oh, Christina,
Christina, what a wonderful thing it is to live and
to be happy!—Oh, but it’s really too horrid of
me! Here am I talking about nothing but my
own concerns. [<i>Seats herself upon a footstool close
to <span class='sc'>Christina</span>, and lays her arms on her friend’s lap.</i>]
Oh, don’t be angry with me! Now tell me, is it
really true that you didn’t love your husband?
What made you marry him, then?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>My mother was still alive, you see, bedridden
and helpless; and then I had my two younger
brothers to think of. I didn’t think it would be
right for me to refuse him.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps it wouldn’t have been. I suppose he
was rich then?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Very well off, I believe. But his business was
uncertain. It fell to pieces at his death, and there
was nothing left.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And then——?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Then I had to fight my way by keeping a shop, a
little school, anything I could turn my hand to.
The last three years have been one long struggle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>for me. But now it is over, Nora. My poor
mother no longer needs me; she is at rest. And
the boys are in business, and can look after
themselves.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No, Nora; only inexpressibly empty. No one
to live for! [<i>Stands up restlessly.</i>] That’s why I
could not bear to stay any longer in that out-of-the
way corner. Here it must be easier to find something
to take one up—to occupy one’s thoughts.
If I could only get some settled employment—some
office work.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But, Christina, that’s such drudgery, and you

rest.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Going to the window.</i>] I have no father to give

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Rising.</i>] Oh, don’t be vexed with me.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Going to her.</i>] My dear Nora, don’t you be vexed
with me. The worst of a position like mine is
that it makes one so bitter. You have no one to
work for, yet you have to be always on the strain.
You must live; and so you become selfish. When
I heard of the happy change in your fortunes—can
you believe it?—I was glad for my own sake
more than for yours.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>
  </div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And so he shall, Christina. Just you leave it all
to me. I shall lead up to it beautifully!—I shall

<p class='c001'>Listen to me, Nora dear: haven’t you been a

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Sitting upright again.</i>] Is it rash to save one’s

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But it would have been fatal for him to know!
Can’t you understand that? He wasn’t even to
suspect how ill he was. The doctors came to me
privately and told me his life was in danger—that
nothing could save him but a winter in the
South. Do you think I didn’t try diplomacy first?
I told him how I longed to have a trip abroad, like
other young wives; I wept and prayed; I said he
ought to think of my condition, and not to thwart
me; and then I hinted that he could borrow the
money. But then, Christina, he got almost angry.
He said I was frivolous, and that it was his duty
as a husband not to yield to my whims and fancies—so
he called them. Very well, thought I, but
saved you must be; and then I found the way to
do it.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No; never. Papa died at that very time. I
meant to have told him all about it, and begged
him to say nothing. But he was so ill—unhappily,
it wasn’t necessary.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>

  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Good heavens! What can you be thinking of?
<em class='gesperrt'>Tell him</em>, when he has such a loathing of debt!
And besides—how painful and humiliating it
would be for Torvald, with his manly self-respect,
to know that he owed anything to me! It would
utterly upset the relation between us; our
beautiful, happy home would never again be what
it is.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Will you never tell him?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Thoughtfully, half-smiling.</i>] Yes, some time
perhaps—many, many years hence, when I’m—not
so pretty. You mustn’t laugh at me! Of
course I mean when Torvald is not so much in
love with me as he is now; when it doesn’t amuse
him any longer to see me dancing about, and
dressing up and acting. Then it might be well
to have something in reserve. [<i>Breaking off.</i>]
Nonsense! nonsense! That time will never come.
Now, what do you say to my grand secret,
Christina? Am I fit for nothing now? You
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>may believe it has cost me a lot of anxiety. It has
been no joke to meet my engagements punctually.
You must know, Christina, that in business there
are things called instalments, and quarterly
interest, that are terribly hard to provide for.
So I’ve had to pinch a little here and there,
wherever I could. I couldn’t save much out of
the housekeeping, for of course Torvald had to
live well. And I couldn’t let the children go
about badly dressed; all I got for them, I spent on
them, the blessed darlings!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Poor Nora! So it had to come out of your own
pocket-money.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, of <a id='corr28.16'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='couse'>course</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_28.16'><ins class='correction' title='couse'>course</ins></a></span>. After all, the whole thing was
my doing. When Torvald gave me money for
clothes, and so on, I never spent more than half
of it; I always bought the simplest and cheapest
things. It’s a mercy that everything suits me so
well—Torvald never had any suspicions. But it
was often very hard, Christina dear. For it’s nice
to be beautifully dressed—now, isn’t it?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, and besides that, I made money in other
ways. Last winter I was so lucky—I got a heap
of copying to do. I shut myself up every evening
and wrote far into the night. Oh, sometimes I
was so tired, so tired. And yet it was splendid to
work in that way and earn money. I almost felt
as if I was a man.</p>

<p class='c001'>Well, I can’t precisely say. It’s difficult to keep

I really didn’t know where to turn. [<i>Smiles.</i>]

<p class='c001'>Oh dear, can’t you understand? There wasn’t
any old gentleman: it was only what I used to
dream and dream when I was at my wits’ end for
money. But it doesn’t matter now—the tiresome
old creature may stay where he is for me. I care
nothing for him or his will; for now my troubles
are over. [<i>Springing up.</i>] Oh, Christina, how
glorious it is to think of! Free from all anxiety!
Free, quite free. To be able to play and romp
about with the children; to have things tasteful
and pretty in the house, exactly as Torvald likes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>it! And then the spring will soon be here, with
the great blue sky. Perhaps then we shall have
a little holiday. Perhaps I shall see the sea

<p class='c001'>Yes. He has got some sort of place there.
[<i>To</i> <span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden</span>.] I don’t know whether, in your

grubbing and sniffing around in search of moral

some good position, where they can keep a watch
upon him. Men with a clean bill of health they
leave out in the cold.</p>

you probably did not give much thought to the

<p class='c001'>Your father died on the 29th of September.
But look here: he has dated his signature
October 2nd! Is not that remarkable, Mrs.
Helmer? [<span class='sc'>Nora</span> <i>is silent.</i>] Can you explain it?
[<span class='sc'>Nora</span> <i>continues silent.</i>] It is noteworthy, too, that
the words “October 2nd” and the year are not
in your father’s handwriting, but in one which I
believe I know. Well, this may be explained;
your father may have forgotten to date his signature,
and somebody may have added the date at
random, before the fact of your father’s death
was known. There is nothing wrong in that.
Everything depends on the signature. Of course
it is genuine, Mrs. Helmer? It was really your
father himself who wrote his name here?</p>

<p class='c001'>It was impossible. Father was ill. If I had

tell him why I wanted the money; but he was so
ill I really could not tell him that my husband’s

<p class='c001'>It generally comes from the mother’s side; but

<p class='c001'>Yes, I was just passing. There’s something you

To-morrow evening there’s to be a fancy
ball at Consul Stenborg’s overhead, and Torvald
wants me to appear as a Neapolitan fisher-girl,
and dance the tarantella; I learned it at Capri.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yes, Torvald wishes it. Look, this is the

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Rises and walks across the room.</i>] Oh, yesterday,
it didn’t seem so pleasant as usual.—You should
have come to town a little sooner, Christina.—Torvald
has certainly the art of making home
bright and beautiful.</p>

<p class='c001'>You too, I should think, or you wouldn’t be
your father’s daughter. But tell me—is Doctor
Rank always so depressed as he was last evening?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No, yesterday it was particularly noticeable.
You see, he suffers from a dreadful illness. He
has spinal consumption, poor fellow. They say
his father was a horrible man, who kept mistresses
and all sorts of things—so the son has been sickly
from his childhood, you understand.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Lets her sewing fall into her lap.</i>] Why, my

things?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Moving about the room.</i>] Oh, when one has
three children, one sometimes has visits from
women who are half—half doctors—and they talk
of one thing and another.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Goes on sewing; a short pause.</i>] Does Doctor
Rank come here every day?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Every day of his life. He has been Torvald’s
most intimate friend from boyhood, and he’s a
good friend of mine too. Doctor Rank is quite
one of the family.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But tell me—is he quite sincere? I mean,
isn’t he rather given to flattering people?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No, quite the contrary. Why should you think
so?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>When you introduced us yesterday he said he
had often heard my name; but I noticed afterwards
that your husband had no notion who I
was. How could Doctor Rank——?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>He was quite right, Christina. You see, Torvald
loves me so indescribably, he wants to have me
all to himself, as he says. When we were first
married he was almost jealous if I even mentioned
any of my old friends at home; so naturally I
gave up doing it. But I often talk of the old
times to Doctor Rank, for he likes to hear about
them.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Linden.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Listen to me, Nora! You are still a child in

<p class='c001'>Yes, that’s so good of you. But instead of

<p class='c001'>It’s not that, Torvald. It’s for your own sake.

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>Yes—yes, of course. Only think of the shameful
slanders wicked people used to write about
father. I believe they would have got him dismissed
if you hadn’t been sent to look into the
thing, and been kind to him, and helped him.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Helmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>My little Nora, between your father and me

father was not altogether unimpeachable. I am;
and I hope to remain so.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>

you——</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Helmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And it is just by pleading his cause that you
make it impossible for me to keep him. It’s
already known at the Bank that I intend to
dismiss Krogstad. If it were now reported that
the new manager let himself be turned round
his wife’s little finger——</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>Helmer.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, nothing, so long as a wilful woman can
have her way——! I am to make myself a
laughing-stock to the whole staff, and set people
saying that I am open to all sorts of outside
influence? Take my word for it, I should soon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>feel the consequences. And besides—there is
one thing that makes Krogstad impossible for me
to work with——</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>And I hear he is good at his work. But the
fact is, he was a college chum of mine—there was
one of those rash friendships between us that one
so often repents of later. I may as well confess
it at once—he calls me by my Christian name;<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c012'><sup>[9]</sup></a>
and he is tactless enough to do it even when
others are present. He delights in putting on
airs of familiarity—Torvald here, Torvald there!
I assure you it’s most painful to me. He would
make my position at the Bank perfectly unendurable.</p>

<p class='c001'>Only to see how you are getting on, Mrs. Helmer.
I’ve been thinking about you all day.
Even a mere money-lender, a gutter-journalist,

fight my way up, step by step. Now, I’ve been
thrust down again, and I will not be satisfied with
merely being reinstated as a matter of grace. I

dances her tarantella with wild applause, and well
she deserved it, I must say—though there was,
perhaps, a little too much nature in her rendering
of the idea—more than was, strictly speaking,
artistic. But never mind—the point is, she made
a great success, a tremendous success. Was I to
let her remain after that—to weaken the impression?
Not if I know it. I took my sweet little
Capri girl—my capricious little Capri girl, I might
say—under my arm; a rapid turn round the room,
a curtsey to all sides, and—as they say in novels—the
lovely apparition vanished! An exit should
always be effective, Mrs. Linden; but I can’t get
Nora to see it. By Jove! it’s warm here. [<i>Throws

soon. To-morrow all this will seem quite different—everything
will be as before. I shall not need
to tell you again that I forgive you; you will feel
for yourself that it is true. How could you think
I could find it in my heart to drive you away, or
even so much as to reproach you? Oh, you don’t

thing indescribably sweet and soothing to a man

her, from the bottom of his heart. She becomes
his property in a double sense. She is as though
born again; she has become, so to speak, at once
his wife and his child. That is what you shall
henceforth be to me, my bewildered, helpless
darling. Don’t be troubled about anything,

<p class='c001'>Yes, it is so, Torvald. While I was at home
with father, he used to tell me all his opinions,
and I held the same opinions. If I had others I
said nothing about them, because he wouldn’t
have liked it. He used to call me his doll-child,

<p class='c001'>[<i>Undisturbed.</i>] I mean I passed from father’s
hands into yours. You arranged everything
according to your taste; and I got the same tastes
as you; or I pretended to—I don’t know which—both
ways, perhaps; sometimes one and sometimes
the other. When I look back on it now, I seem
to have been living here like a beggar, from hand
to mouth. I lived by performing tricks for you,
Torvald. But you would have it so. You and
father have done me a great wrong. It is your

<p class='c001'>No; only merry. And you have always been so
kind to me. But our house has been nothing but
a play-room. Here I have been your doll-wife,
just as at home I used to be papa’s doll-child.
And the children, in their turn, have been my
dolls. I thought it fun when you played with me,
just as the children did when I played with them.
That has been our marriage, Torvald.</p>

<p class='c001'>That I no longer believe. I believe that before

are—or at least that I should try to become one.
I know that most people agree with you, Torvald,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>and that they say so in books. But henceforth I
can’t be satisfied with what most people say, and
what is in books. I must think things out for

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I know nothing but what Pastor Hansen told
me when I was confirmed. He explained that
religion was this and that. When I get away from
all this and stand alone, I will look into that
matter too. I will see whether what he taught
me is right, or, at any rate, whether it is right
for me.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    <div><span class='sc'>Helmer.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, this is unheard of! And from so young a

let me appeal to your conscience—for I suppose
you have some moral feeling? Or, answer me:
perhaps you have none?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, Torvald, it’s not easy to say. I really
don’t know—I am all at sea about these things.
I only know that I think quite differently from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>you about them. I hear, too, that the laws are
different from what I thought; but I can’t believe
that they can be right. It appears that a woman
has no right to spare her dying father, or to save
her husband’s life! I don’t believe that.</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c001'>No, I do not. But now I shall try to learn.

or I.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Helmer.</span></div>
  </div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, I can. It was this evening, when the miracle

    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I have waited so patiently all these eight years;
for of course I saw clearly enough that miracles
don’t happen every day. When this crushing blow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>threatened me, I said to myself so confidently,
“Now comes the miracle!”  When Krogstad’s
letter lay in the box, it never for a moment
occurred to me that you would think of submitting
to that man’s conditions. I was convinced that
you would say to him, “Make it known to all the
world”; and that then——</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>Nora.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>Then I firmly believed that you would come

<p class='c001'>Very likely. But you neither think nor talk

terror was over—not for what threatened me, but
for yourself—when there was nothing more to fear—then
it seemed to you as though nothing had
happened. I was your lark again, your doll, just
as before—whom you would take twice as much
care of in future, because she was so weak and
fragile. [<i>Stands up.</i>] Torvald—in that moment

two doors to the right. In the middle of the room
a round table, with chairs about it. On the table
lie books, periodicals, and newspapers. In the

sofa, with a work-table in front of it. In the
background, the room is continued into a somewhat
narrower conservatory, the walls of which
are formed by large panes of glass. In the right-hand
wall of the conservatory is a door leading
down into the garden. Through the glass wall
a gloomy fjord-landscape is faintly visible, veiled
by steady rain.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>Yes, you may well say so. But there’s nothing
of that sort to fear with him. I’m quite curious to
see whether you know him again. He’ll be down
presently; he’s upstairs just now, resting a little
on the sofa. But do sit down, my dear Pastor.</p>

<p class='c001'>Very well. Then let me show you——[<i>He

Tell me, Mrs. Alving, how do these books come to
be here?</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Do you read this sort of literature?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Certainly I do.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Do you feel better or happier for such reading?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I feel, so to speak, more secure.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>That is strange. How do you mean?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, I seem to find explanation and confirmation
of all sorts of things I myself have been
thinking. For that is the wonderful part of it,
Pastor Manders—there is really nothing new in
these books, nothing but what most people think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>and believe. Only most people either don’t
formulate it to themselves, or else keep quiet
about it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>

most people——?</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I do, indeed.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But surely not in this country? Not here
among us?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, certainly; here as elsewhere.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, I really must say——!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>For the rest, what do you object to in these
books?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Object to in them? You surely do not suppose
that I have nothing better to do than to study
such publications as these?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>That is to say, you know nothing of what you
are condemning?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I have read enough <em class='gesperrt'>about</em> these writings to
disapprove of them.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes; but your own judgment——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>My dear Mrs. Alving, there are many occasions
in life when one must rely upon others. Things
are so ordered in this world; and it is well that
they are. Otherwise, what would become of
society?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, well, I daresay you’re right there.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Besides, I of course do not deny that there may
be much that is attractive in such books. Nor
can I blame you for wishing to keep up with the
intellectual movements that are said to be going
on in the great world—where you have let your
son pass so much of his life. But——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Lowering his voice.</i>] But one should not talk
about it, Mrs. Alving. One is certainly not bound
to account to everybody for what one reads and
thinks within one’s own four walls.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Of course not; I quite agree with you.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Only think, now, how you are bound to consider
the interests of this Orphanage, which you decided
on founding at a time when—if I understand you
rightly—you thought very differently on spiritual
matters.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, yes; I quite admit that. But it was about
the Orphanage——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It was about the Orphanage we were to speak;
yes. All I say is: prudence, my dear lady! And
now let us get to business. [<i>Opens the packet, and
takes out a number of papers.</i>] Do you see these?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The documents?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>All—and in perfect order. I can tell you it
was hard work to get them in time. I had to
put on strong pressure. The authorities are
almost morbidly scrupulous when there is any
decisive step to be taken. But here they are at
last. [<i>Looks through the bundle.</i>] See! here is the
formal deed of gift of the parcel of ground known
as Solvik in the Manor of Rosenvold, with all the
newly constructed buildings, schoolrooms, master’s
house, and chapel. And here is the legal fiat for
the endowment and for the Bye-laws of the Institution.
Will you look at them? [<i>Reads.</i>] “Bye-laws
for the Children’s Home to be known as
‘Captain Alving’s Foundation.’”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Looks long at the paper.</i>] So there it is.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I have chosen the designation “Captain” rather
than “Chamberlain.” “Captain” looks less
pretentious.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, yes; just as you think best.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And here you have the Bank Account of the
capital lying at interest to cover the current
expenses of the Orphanage.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Thank you; but please keep it—it will be more
convenient.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>With pleasure. I think we will leave the
money in the Bank for the present. The interest
is certainly not what we could wish—four per
cent. and six months’ notice of withdrawal. If a
good mortgage could be found later on—of course
it must be a first mortgage and an unimpeachable
security—then we could consider the matter.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Certainly, my dear Pastor Manders. You are
the best judge in these things.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I will keep my eyes open at any rate.—But now
there is one thing more which I have several
times been intending to ask you.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And what is that?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Shall the Orphanage buildings be insured or
not?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c001'>Of course they must be insured.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, wait a moment, Mrs. Alving. Let us look
into the matter a little more closely.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I have everything insured; buildings and

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Of course you have—on your own estate. And
so have I—of course. But here, you see, it is
quite another matter. The Orphanage is to be
consecrated, as it were, to a higher purpose.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, but that’s no reason——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>For my own part, I should certainly not see
the smallest impropriety in guarding against all
contingencies——</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c001'>No, I should think not.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But what is the general feeling in the neighbourhood?
You, of course, know better than I.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well—the general feeling——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Is there any considerable number of people—really
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>responsible people—who might be
scandalised?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>What do you mean by “really responsible
people”?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, I mean people in such independent and
influential positions that one cannot help attaching
some weight to their opinions.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>There are several people of that sort here, who
would very likely be shocked if——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>There, you see! In town we have many such
people. Think of all my colleague’s adherents!
People would be only too ready to interpret our
action as a sign that neither you nor I had the
right faith in a Higher Providence.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But for your own part, my dear Pastor, you can
at least tell yourself that——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, I know—I know; my conscience would
be quite easy, that is true enough. But nevertheless
we should not escape grave misinterpretation;
and that might very likely react unfavourably
upon the Orphanage.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, in that case——</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Nor can I entirely lose sight of the difficult—I
may even say painful—position in which <em>I</em>
might perhaps be placed. In the leading circles
of the town, people take a lively interest in
this Orphanage. It is, of course, founded partly
for the benefit of the town, as well; and it
is to be hoped it will, to a considerable extent,
result in lightening our Poor Rates. Now, as I
have been your adviser, and have had the business
arrangements in my hands, I cannot but fear that
I may have to bear the brunt of fanaticism——</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>

<p class='c001'>Ah, that melancholy weakness! But he is often
driven to it by his injured leg, he says. Last time
he was in town I was really touched by him. He
came and thanked me so warmly for having got
him work here, so that he might be near Regina.</p>

That is what I cannot help liking about Jacob
Engstrand: he comes to you so helplessly, accusing

him to have Regina home again——</p>

<p class='c001'>Yes, but there is an expression about the corners

reminds one exactly of Alving: at any rate, now
that he is smoking.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Not in the least. Oswald has rather a clerical

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, yes; some of my colleagues have much the

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Oswald.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Does so.</i>] By all means. I only wanted to try

<p class='c001'>Yes. I was quite small at the time. I recollect

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Oswald.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, I recollect it distinctly. He took me on
his knee, and gave me the pipe. “Smoke, boy,”
he said; “smoke away, boy!” And I smoked as
hard as I could, until I felt I was growing quite
pale, and the perspiration stood in great drops on
my forehead.  Then he burst out laughing
heartily——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>No, mother, I assure you I didn’t dream it. For—don’t
you remember <em class='gesperrt'>this</em>?—you came and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>carried me out into the nursery. Then I was sick,

<p class='c001'>What are they to do? Let me tell you, Mr.

<p class='c001'>Well, then, allow me to inform you. I have
met with it when one or other of our pattern

<p class='c001'>Have you never heard these respectable men,

    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Here, in my loneliness, I have come to the same

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You are greatly to be pitied, Mrs. Alving. But
now I must speak seriously to you. And now it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>is no longer your business manager and adviser,
your own and your husband’s early friend, who
stands before you. It is the priest—the priest who
stood before you in the moment of your life when
you had gone farthest astray.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And what has the priest to say to me?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I will first stir up your memory a little. The
moment is well chosen. To-morrow will be the
tenth anniversary of your husband’s death. To-morrow
the memorial in his honour will be unveiled.
To-morrow I shall have to speak to the
whole assembled multitude. But to-day I will
speak to you alone.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Very well, Pastor Manders. Speak.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Do you remember that after less than a year of
married life you stood on the verge of an abyss?
That you forsook your house and home? That you
fled from your husband? Yes, Mrs. Alving—fled,
fled, and refused to return to him, however much
he begged and prayed you?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Have you forgotten how infinitely miserable I
was in that first year?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It is the very mark of the spirit of rebellion to
crave for happiness in this life. What right have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>we human beings to happiness? We have simply
to do our duty, Mrs. Alving! And your duty was
to hold firmly to the man you had once chosen,
and to whom you were bound by the holiest ties.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You know very well what sort of life Alving was
leading—what excesses he was guilty of.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I know very well what rumours there were about
him; and I am the last to approve the life he led
in his young days, if report did not wrong him.
But a wife is not appointed to be her husband’s
judge. It was your duty to bear with humility the
cross which a Higher Power had, in its wisdom,
laid upon you. But instead of that you rebelliously
throw away the cross, desert the back-slider
whom you should have supported, go and
risk your good name and reputation, and—nearly
succeed in ruining other people’s reputation into
the bargain.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Other people’s? One other person’s, you mean.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It was incredibly reckless of you to seek refuge
with me.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>With our clergyman? With our intimate friend?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Just on that account. Yes, you may thank God
that I possessed the necessary firmness; that I
succeeded in dissuading you from your wild
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>designs; and that it was vouchsafed me to lead
you back to the path of duty, and home to your
lawful husband.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, Pastor Manders, <em class='gesperrt'>that</em> was certainly your
work.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I was but a poor instrument in a Higher Hand.
And what a blessing has it not proved to you, all the
days of your life, that I induced you to resume the
yoke of duty and obedience! Did not everything
happen as I foretold? Did not Alving turn his
back on his errors, as a man should? Did he not
live with you from that time, lovingly and blamelessly,
all his days? Did he not become a benefactor
to the whole district? And did he not help
you to rise to his own level, so that you, little by
little, became his assistant in all his undertakings?
And a capital assistant, too—oh, I know, Mrs.
Alving, <em class='gesperrt'>that</em> praise is due to you.—But now I
come to the next great error in your life.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>What do you mean?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Just as you once disowned a wife’s duty, so you
have since disowned a mother’s.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Ah——!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You have been all your life under the dominion
of a pestilent spirit of self-will. The whole bias
of your mind has been towards insubordination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>and lawlessness. You have never known how to
endure any bond. Everything that has weighed
upon you in life you have cast away without care
or conscience, like a burden you were free to throw
off at will. It did not please you to be a wife any
longer, and you left your husband. You found it
troublesome to be a mother, and you sent your
child forth among strangers.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, that is true. I did so.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And thus you have become a stranger to him.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No! no! I am not.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, you are; you <em class='gesperrt'>must</em> be. And in what state
of mind has he returned to you? Bethink yourself
well, Mrs. Alving. You sinned greatly against your
husband;—that you recognise by raising yonder
memorial to him. Recognise now, also, how you
have sinned against your son—there may yet be
time to lead him back from the paths of error.
Turn back yourself, and save what may yet be
saved in him. For [<i>With uplifted forefinger</i>] verily,
Mrs. Alving, you are a guilt-laden mother!—This
I have thought it my duty to say to you.</p>
<div class='c019'>[<i>Silence.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Slowly and with self-control.</i>] You have now

<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>I shall not speak to-morrow. But now I will speak

<p class='c001'>All that you have just said about my husband

back to the path of duty—as you called it—about
all that you know nothing from personal observation.

<p class='c001'>Yes; and in my husband’s lifetime you never

    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>That has been my ceaseless struggle, day after
day. After Oswald’s birth, I thought Alving
seemed to be a little better. But it did not last
long. And then I had to struggle twice as hard,
fighting as though for life or death, so that nobody
should know what sort of man my child’s father
was. And you know what power Alving had of
winning people’s hearts. Nobody seemed able to
believe anything but good of him. He was one
of those people whose life does not bite upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>their reputation. But at last, Mr. Manders—for
you must know the whole story—the most
repulsive thing of all happened.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>More repulsive than what you have told me!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I had gone on bearing with him, although I
knew very well the secrets of his life out of doors.
But when he brought the scandal within our own
walls——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Impossible! Here!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes; here in our own home. It was there
[<i>Pointing towards the first door on the right</i>], in the
dining-room, that I first came to know of it. I
was busy with something in there, and the door
was standing ajar. I heard our housemaid come
up from the garden, with water for those flowers.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well——?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Soon after, I heard Alving come in too. I heard
him say something softly to her. And then I
heard—[<i>With a short laugh</i>]—oh! it still sounds
in my ears, so hateful and yet so ludicrous—I
heard my own servant-maid whisper, “Let me
go, Mr. Alving! Let me be!”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>What unseemly levity on his part! But it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>cannot have been more than levity, Mrs. Alving;
believe me, it cannot.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I soon knew what to believe. Mr. Alving had
his way with the girl; and that connection had
consequences, Mr. Manders.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>As though petrified.</i>] Such things in this house!
in this house!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I had borne a great deal in this house. To keep
him at home in the evenings, and at night, I had
to make myself his boon companion in his secret
orgies up in his room. There I have had to sit
alone with him, to clink glasses and drink with
him, and to listen to his ribald, silly talk. I have
had to fight with him to get him dragged to
bed——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Moved.</i>] And you were able to bear all this!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I had to bear it for my little boy’s sake. But
when the last insult was added; when my own
servant-maid——; then I swore to myself: This
shall come to an end! And so I took the reins
into my own hand—the whole control—over him
and everything else. For now I had a weapon
against him, you see; he dared not oppose me.
It was then I sent Oswald away from home. He
was nearly seven years old, and was beginning to
observe and ask questions, as children do. That
I could not bear.  It seemed to me the child
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>must be poisoned by merely breathing the air of
this polluted home. That was why I sent him
away. And now you can see, too, why he was
never allowed to set foot inside his home so long
as his father lived. No one knows what that
cost me.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You have indeed had a life of trial.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I could never have borne it if I had not had my
work. For I may truly say that I have worked!
All the additions to the estate—all the improvements—all
the labour-saving appliances, that
Alving was so much praised for having introduced—do
you suppose he had energy for anything of
the sort?—he, who lay all day on the sofa, reading
an old Court Guide! No; but I may tell you <em class='gesperrt'>this</em>
too: when he had his better intervals, it was I
who urged him on; it was I who had to drag the
whole load when he relapsed into his evil ways,
or sank into querulous wretchedness.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And it is to this man that you raise a memorial?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>There you see the power of an evil conscience.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Evil——? What do you mean?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It always seemed to me impossible but that the
truth must come out and be believed. So the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>Orphanage was to deaden all rumours and set
every doubt at rest.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>In that you have certainly not missed your aim,
Mrs. Alving.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And besides, I had one other reason. I was
determined that Oswald, my own boy, should
inherit nothing whatever from his father.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Then it is Alving’s fortune that——?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes. The sums I have spent upon the Orphanage,
year by year, make up the amount—I have
reckoned it up precisely—the amount which made
Lieutenant Alving “a good match” in his day.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It was my purchase-money. I do not choose
that that money should pass into Oswald’s hands.
My son shall have everything from me—everything.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>Unfortunately there is no possibility of mistake.
Johanna confessed everything to me; and Alving
could not deny it. So there was nothing to be
done but to get the matter hushed up.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The girl left our service at once, and got a good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>sum of money to hold her tongue for the time.
The rest she managed for herself when she got to
town. She renewed her old acquaintance with
Engstrand, no doubt let him see that she had
money in her purse, and told him some tale about
a foreigner who put in here with a yacht that
summer. So she and Engstrand got married in
hot haste. Why, you married them yourself.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But then how to account for——? I recollect
distinctly Engstrand coming to give notice of the
marriage. He was quite overwhelmed with contrition,
and bitterly reproached himself for the

there, it was as though ghosts rose up before me.
But I almost think we are all of us ghosts, Pastor
Manders. It is not only what we have inherited
from our father and mother that “walks” in us. It
is all sorts of dead ideas, and lifeless old beliefs,
and so forth. They have no vitality, but they
cling to us all the same, and we cannot shake
them off. Whenever I take up a newspaper,
I seem to see ghosts gliding between the lines.
There must be ghosts all the country over,
as thick as the sands of the sea. And then
we are, one and all, so pitifully afraid of the
light.</p>

when I prepared her for confirmation. But in the
meantime, she ought to be at home, under her
father’s eye——Ah! but Engstrand is not——That
he—that <em class='gesperrt'>he</em>—could so hide the truth from
me!      [<i>A knock at the door into the hall.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>Yes, every now and then—just a little edification,

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, you see, Engstrand, I have a question to

<p class='c001'>Oh, God help us, your Reverence! we’d better

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, that is just what we must talk about.

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Engstrand.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c001'>Why—a man’s conscience—it can be bad enough

</div>

<p class='c001'>About Regina! Lord, what a turn you gave

  <div class='nf-center'>

<p class='c001'>We will hope not. But I mean, what is the

<p class='c001'>[<i>Uncertain.</i>] Well—h’m—your Reverence knows

    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Come now, no more prevarication! Your wife

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And you have hidden the truth from me all

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>Have I deserved this of you, Engstrand? Have

Have I not?</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Engstrand.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>It would have been a poor look-out for me

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>And this is how you reward me! You cause
me to enter falsehoods in the Church Register,
and you withhold from me, year after year, the
explanations you owed alike to me and to the
truth. Your conduct has been wholly inexcusable,

done with you!</p>

<p class='c001'>[<i>With a sigh.</i>] Yes! I suppose there’s no help

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>How can you possibly justify yourself?</p>

<p class='c001'>Who could ever have thought she’d have gone

    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Engstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Lord bless you, I don’t mean just exactly the
same. But I mean, if your Reverence had anything
to be ashamed of in the eyes of the world, as
the saying goes. We menfolk oughtn’t to judge
a poor woman too hardly, your Reverence.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Engstrand.</span></div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Might I make so bold as to ask your Reverence

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, if you want to.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Engstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Isn’t it right and proper for a man to raise up

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Most certainly it is.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Engstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And isn’t a man bound to keep his sacred
word?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Why, of course he is; but——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Engstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>When Johanna had got into trouble through
that Englishman—or it might have been an
American or a Russian, as they call them—well,
you see, she came down into the town. Poor
thing, she’d sent me about my business once or
twice before: for she couldn’t bear the sight of
anything as wasn’t handsome; and I’d got this
damaged leg of mine. Your Reverence recollects
how I ventured up into a dancing saloon, where
seafaring men was carrying on with drink and
devilry, as the saying goes. And then, when I
was for giving them a bit of an admonition to
lead a new life——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>At the window.</i>] H’m——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I know all about that, Engstrand; the ruffians
threw you downstairs. You have told me of the
affair already. Your infirmity is an honour to you.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Engstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I’m not puffed up about it, your Reverence.
But what I wanted to say was, that when she came
and confessed all to me, with weeping and gnashing
of teeth, I can tell your Reverence I was sore
at heart to hear it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Were you indeed, Engstrand? Well, go on.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span><span class='sc'>Engstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>So I says to her, “The American, he’s sailing
about on the boundless sea. And as for you,
Johanna,” says I, “you’ve committed a grievous
sin, and you’re a fallen creature. But Jacob Engstrand,”
says I, “he’s got two good legs to stand
upon, he has——” You see, your Reverence, I
was speaking figurative-like.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I understand quite well. Go on.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Engstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, that was how I raised her up and made
an honest woman of her, so as folks shouldn’t get
to know how as she’d gone astray with foreigners.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>In all that you acted very well. Only I cannot
approve of your stooping to take money——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Engstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Money? I? Not a farthing!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Inquiringly to <span class='sc'>Mrs. Alving</span>.</i>] But——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Engstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, wait a minute!—now I recollect. Johanna
<em class='gesperrt'>did</em> have a trifle of money. But I would have
nothing to do with <em class='gesperrt'>that</em>. “No,” says I, “that’s
mammon; that’s the wages of sin. This dirty
gold—or notes, or whatever it was—we’ll just fling
that back in the American’s face,” says I. But
he was off and away, over the stormy sea, your
Reverence.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Was he really, my good fellow?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Engstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>He was indeed, sir. So Johanna and I, we
agreed that the money should go to the child’s
education; and so it did, and I can account for
every blessed farthing of it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Why, this alters the case considerably.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Engstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>That’s just how it stands, your Reverence. And
I make so bold as to say as I’ve been an honest
father to Regina, so far as my poor strength went;
for I’m but a weak vessel, worse luck!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, well, my good fellow——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Engstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>All the same, I bear myself witness as I’ve
brought up the child, and lived kindly with poor
Johanna, and ruled over my own house, as the
Scripture has it. But it couldn’t never enter my
head to go to your Reverence and puff myself up
and boast because even the likes of me had done
some good in the world. No, sir; when anything
of that sort happens to Jacob Engstrand, he holds
his tongue about it. It don’t happen so terrible
often, I daresay. And when I do come to see
your Reverence, I find a mortal deal that’s wicked
and weak to talk about. For I said it before, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>I says it again—a man’s conscience isn’t always as
clean as it might be.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Give me your hand, Jacob Engstrand.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Engstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, Lord! your Reverence——?</p>

we are!</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You? On the contrary, it is I who ought to

  <div class='nf-center'>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Manders.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, assuredly. And I do it with all my heart.
Forgive me for misunderstanding you. I only
wish I could give you some proof of my hearty
regret, and of my good-will towards you——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Engstrand.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>Would your Reverence do it?</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well then, here’s the very chance. With the

    <div><span class='sc'>Engstrand.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes; it might be a sort of Orphanage, too, in a
manner of speaking. There’s such a many temptations
for seafaring folk ashore. But in this Home
of mine, a man might feel like as he was under

<p class='c001'>Why, it all came of this here prayer-meeting,

</div>

<p class='c001'>And I <em class='gesperrt'>saw</em> as clear as daylight how your

work into which he could throw himself heart

</div>

<p class='c001'>There was no anchor for the <a href='#f14'>footnote</a> on p. 276. An anchor
has been placed on the most likely <a href='#r14'>spot</a>, based on the context.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are quite a few instances of missing punctuation. The
conventional period following the character’s name is sometimes
missing and has been added for consistency’s sake without
further comment. Those missing from setting and stage direction
are also added without comment, since there is no obvious purpose to be
served by the omission. However, the restoration of punctuation
missing from dialogue is noted below, since the punctuation is
frequently expressive. Several instances of dubious ‘?’ marks have
been corrected, based on context.</p>

<p class='c001'>Volume I of this series included errata for each succeeding volume,
but noted none in Volume VII.</p>

<p class='c001'>The contraction ‘mustn’t’ appears twenty-one times, but twice
without the internal ‘t’ as ‘musn’t’. These have been corrected.</p>

<p class='c001'>Errors deemed most likely to be the printer’s have been corrected, and
are noted here. The references are to the page and line in the original.</p>
